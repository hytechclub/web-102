# Week 3: Basic JS Concepts
Introduce some additional JavaScript concepts, still staying fairly basic. This lesson covers:
- Comments
- Data Types
- Math

## Warm Up
Prompt the students with the following, and allow them to ponder it briefly:
- Think of some different types of data you might see on a website.
- How do you think that data is stored inside a computer?

Discussion will take place during the lecture.

## Lecture
The lecture introduces the following concepts:
- JavaScript comments
- Data Types in JavaScript (only strings and numbers for now)
    - This ties back to the Warm Up activity
- Math with numbers
    - Converting a string to a number

## Follow-Along Activity
Follow the instructions in the [SpeedCalculatorInstructions.md](SpeedCalculatorInstructions.md) file to complete the code-along.

## Review Activity
After the Follow-Along activity, play a game to review some of the concepts covered up until this point.

Have the students split into two teams. Each team will line up, and have one representative face off against a representative from the opposing team. Questions are in the [Review](Review.pptx) slides. Whichever student answers first wins a point for their team. Keep track of the points on the whiteboard. The winning team receives candy.

## Individual Activity
The students should follow the instructions in the [GeometryCalculationsInstructions.md](GeometryCalculationsInstructions.md) file. The goal is to create a simple triangle area calculator.

## Challenge
There is a challenge is within the Individual activity. There is also a separate set of challenges contained in [AdditionalChallenges.md](AdditionalChallenges.md).
