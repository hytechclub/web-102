# Week 3: Data Types
This lesson covers two basic data types in JavaScript: strings and numbers. It also includes a brief introduction to code comments.

## Warm Up
Prompt the students with the following, and allow them to ponder it briefly:

- Think of some different types of data you might see on a website.
- How do you think that data is stored inside a computer?

Discussion will take place during the lecture.

## Lecture: Data Types
The [presentation](DataTypes.pptx) introduces the following concepts:

- JavaScript comments
- Data Types in JavaScript (only strings and numbers for now)
    - This ties back to the Warm Up activity
- Math with numbers
    - Converting a string to a number
- Template literals

## Code-Along: Speed Calculator
Follow the instructions to complete the [Speed Calculator Code-Along](SpeedCalcCodeAlong.md).

## Formative Assessment: Review Activity
After the Follow-Along activity, play a game to review some of the concepts covered up until this point.

Have the students split into two teams. Each team will line up, and have one representative face off against a representative from the opposing team. Questions are in the [Review](Review.pptx) slides, and the answers are in the slide notes. Whichever student answers first wins a point for their team. Keep track of the points on the whiteboard. The winning team receives candy.

## Self-Paced Work: Mad Libs
The students should follow the instructions on the [Self-Paced Work](SelfPacedWork.md) page. The goal is to create a simple [mad libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs) game. The solution for the self-paced work is available [here](SelfPacedWorkComplete.js).

## Challenges
Students can continue working on their mad libs if desired. There is also a separate set of [challenges](Challenges.md). The solutions for the challenges are available [here](ChallengesComplete.js).
