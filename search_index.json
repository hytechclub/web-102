Repl, then follow the instructions below to build a simple webpage!\nTo fork the Repl, click the \"Fork Repl\" button on the page:\n\nAdd the Basic HTML Elements\nAdd the foundational elements to the index.html file. Start with , then add  and  between the HTML tags.\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\nAdd a Header\nBetween the opening and closing body tags, add an h3 element. Within the h3 element, add the proper text.\nDespicable Me Fan Site\n\nAdd an Image\nAdd an image to the page.\n\nGo to Google Images\nFind an image, and copy the image address/URL/location\nCreate an img tag, and set its src attribute to be the URL for the image\n\n\n\nAdd a Paragraph\nUnder the img element, add a p element that contains the text for the paragraph.\nDespicable Me is a great film filled with several memorable characters and zany plot lines.\n\nAdd Another Header\nUnder the p, add another h3 header that will serve as the title for a list.\nTop Three Movies Of All Time\n\nAdd a List\nUnder the h3, create an ol element. Between the opening and closing tags, create three li elements with the proper text.\n\n    Despicable Me\n    Despicable Me 2\n    Despicable Me 3\n\n\nCreate a New CSS File\nNow it's time to add some style. Create a new file named style.css, and save it in the same folder as the index.html file. In the file, add a ruleset that will select the body (all the content on the page). Within the ruleset, set the background property to black, and the color property to orange.\nbody {\n    background: black;\n    color: orange;\n}\n\nLink the CSS in the HTML\nAlthough CSS has been added to the style.css file, nothing has changed on the page! This is because the CSS file must be linked in the HTML file.\nIn the index.html file, between the opening and closing head tags, create a link tag. It should have an href attribute with the value style.css, a type attribute with the value text/css, and a rel attribute with the value stylesheet. Now the page should have the styles!\n\n\nAdd an Image Style\nCurrently, the image might be a little big. Use CSS to update its size. In the style.css file, add a ruleset that will select the img. Within the ruleset, set the height property to 200px.\nimg {\n    height: 200px;\n}\n\nAdd a Main Header Style\nNext, it would be nice for the main header to stand out a little more. To select this header specifically, but not any other header, add an id attribute to it in the HTML, and then select it by its ID in the CSS.\nIn the index.html file, find the top h3 header. Add an id attribute with a value of main to the element.\nDespicable Me Fan Site\n\nIn the style.css file, add a ruleset that will select elements with an ID of main using #main. Within the ruleset, set the color property to yellow (this is the color of the minions).\n#main {\n    color: yellow;\n}\n\nFinal Code\nThat's it! The Despicable Me Fan Site looks pretty good.\nindex.html\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n        Despicable Me Fan Site\n        \n        Despicable Me is a great film filled with several memorable characters and zany plot lines.\n\n        Top Three Movies Of All Time\n        \n            Despicable Me\n            Despicable Me 2\n            Despicable Me 3\n        \n\n    \n\n\nstyle.css\nbody {\n    background: black;\n    color: orange;\n}\n\nimg {\n    height: 200px;\n}\n\n#main {\n    color: yellow;\n}\n\n"},"Week01/IntroduceYourself.html":{"url":"Week01/IntroduceYourself.html","title":"Introduce Yourself","keywords":"","body":"Introduce Yourself!\nMake a webpage displaying some basic information about you.

Then, follow the instructions below to build a little text-based JavaScript program that calculates speed using user input.\nPart 1 - Calculating Speed with Hard-coded Values\nTo start, simply create some hard-coded variables, and use those to calculate the speed. This should all take place in the script.js file.\n\nStart by adding an alert statement that welcomes the user to the application\nUnder that, create a new variable named distance, and set its value to 60\nThe unit of measurement for distance is miles\n\n\nUnder that, create another new variable named time, and set its value to 2\nThe unit of measurement for time is hours\n\n\nCalculate the speed given the distance and time, and store it in a new variable named speed\nDistance รท Time = Speed\n\n\nAdd a comment above the speed variable initialization describing the calculation\nCreate another new variable named message, and use string interpolation to tell the user their average speed\nIt should say \"Your average speed was __ mph\" (replacing __ with the result)\nNote that this is possible using a template literal!\n\n\nDisplay the message in an alert\n\nAt this point, the code in the script.js file should look something like this:\nalert(\"Welcome to the Speed Calculator\");\n\nlet distance = 60;\nlet time = 2;\n\n// divide the distance in miles by the time in hours to get average speed\nlet speed = distance / time;\nlet message = `Your average speed was ${speed} mph`;\nalert(message);\n\nRun the program, and it should display an average speed of 30 mph!\nPart 2 - Prompting for Input\nInstead of hard-coding values, the program should ask the user for this information!\n\nCreate a new variable, distanceString, and set its value from a prompt\nAsk \"How far did you travel (in miles)?\"\n\n\nChange the value of the distance variable so that it is the number version of the distanceString variable\nHint: use Number()\n\n\nCreate a new variable, timeString, and set its value from a prompt\nAsk \"How long did it take you (in hours)?\"\n\n\nChange the value of the time variable so that it is the number version of the timeString variable\n\nNote that the calculation stays the same! The only difference is the variable values.\nThe code in the script.js file should look something like this:\nalert(\"Welcome to the Speed Calculator\");\n\nlet distanceString = prompt(\"How far did you travel (in miles)?\");\nlet distance = Number(distanceString);\n\nlet timeString = prompt(\"How long did it take you (in hours)?\");\nlet time = Number(timeString);\n\n// divide the distance in miles by the time in hours to get average speed\nlet speed = distance / time;\nlet message = `Your average speed was ${speed} mph`;\nalert(message);\n\nRun the program, and make sure it calculates the average speed correctly!\nPart 3 - Minutes\nNext, update the program so that it asks the user for their time in minutes instead of hours.\n\nUpdate the question so that it asks for the user's time in minutes\nUpdate the calculation to divide the minutes so that it gives the proper miles per hour!\n\nThe code in the script.js file should look something like this:\nalert(\"Welcome to the Speed Calculator\");\n\nlet distanceString = prompt(\"How far did you travel (in miles)?\");\nlet distance = Number(distanceString);\n\nlet timeString = prompt(\"How long did it take you (in minutes)?\");\nlet time = Number(timeString);\n\n// divide the distance in miles by the time in minutes to get average speed\nlet speed = distance / (time / 60);\nlet message = `Your average speed was ${speed} mph`;\nalert(message);\n\nRun the program, and verify that it calculates the speed correctly!\n"},"Week03/SelfPacedWork.html":{"url":"Week03/SelfPacedWork.html","title":"Self-Paced Work","keywords":"","body":"Self-Paced Work: Mad Libs Exercise\nFollow these instructions to build a simple Mad Libs game using JavaScript!\nBegin by creating a fork of this starter Repl project.\nThe Story: Biography of Leonhard Euler\nThe original story is as follows:\n\nLeonhard Euler was a Swiss mathematician, physicist, and engineer who founded the studies of graph theory and topology. He made pioneering discoveries in many other branches of mathematics such as analytic number theory, complex analysis, and infinitesimal calculus. He was born in Basel, Switzerland, and had three siblings.\n\nTo make this into a Mad Libs story, some words will have to be replaced! Here is the story again, with a list of replacements, with each part of speech within [ and ]:\nLeonhard Euler was a Swiss mathematician, physicist, and [noun] \nwho founded the studies of graph theory and [plural noun]. He made \n[adjective] discoveries in many other branches of mathematics \nsuch as analytic number theory, complex analysis, and [adjective] \ncalculus. He was born in [place], and had [number] siblings.\nThe goal is to create a program that will ask the user for each of those replacements! In all, the user should be prompted for these words:\n\nNoun\nPlural Noun\nAdjective 1\nAdjective 2\nPlace\nNumber\n\nPart 1 - The Prompts\nStart by asking the user for each word they will need to replace!\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nAt the top of the file, add an alert statement welcoming the user to the page\nIt should say \"Welcome to the Mad Libs game!\"\n\n\nUnder that, create a new variable named noun\nSet the variable of the noun variable to a prompt, with the message \"Enter a noun\"\nUnder that, create a new variable named pluralNoun\nSet the variable of the pluralNoun variable to a prompt, with the message \"Enter a plural noun\"\nUnder that, create a new variable named adjective1\nSet the variable of the adjective1 variable to a prompt, with the message \"Enter an adjective\"\nUnder that, create a new variable named adjective2\nSet the variable of the adjective2 variable to a prompt, with the message \"Enter an adjective\"\n\nTry running the code at this point, and make sure it successfully prompts the user for these four words!\nPart 2 - The Modified Story\nNext, print out the story with the words replaced!\n\nUnder the existing code, create a new variable named story\nSet story equal to a new template literal string using backticks (` and `)\nWithin the ` and `, start typing out the first two sentences of the story\nIt should be like Leonhard Euler was a Swiss mathematician, physicist, and [noun] who founded the studies of graph theory and [plural noun]. He made [adjective] discoveries in many other branches of mathematics such as analytic number theory, complex analysis, and [adjective] calculus.\n\n\nIn the template, replace each modified word (e.g., [noun]) with the variable value\nFor example, [noun] should become ${noun}\n\n\nUnder that, use an alert statement to display the story variable!\n\nOnce all of the replacements have been made, try running the code again. The program should ask for some words, and then display the modified story with each entered word replacing one from the original story!\nPart 3 - Continuing the Mad Lib\nNow that there is a story, it's time to continue it!\n\nAbove the story variable, under the existing prompt statements, create two new variables: place and number\nSet the two new variables to be prompt values, asking for the user to enter those types of words\nWithin the story string variable, add the next sentence:\nHe was born in [place], and had [number] siblings.\n\n\nReplace the modified words with the variable values defined above\n\nRun the program again, and verify that the new sentence appears in the final story with the replaced words!\nPart 4 - Another Story\nThis is the fun part: try to come up with a new story, and add some replaceable words! This can be a totally original story, or it can pull from a Wikipedia page, or it can be from an existing short story. It can be anything appropriate!\n"},"Week03/Challenges.html":{"url":"Week03/Challenges.html","title":"Challenges","keywords":"","body":"Challenges\nAccomplish all of the challenges below without using if, switch, or any loops.

Optionally, each challenge can be completed in the same Repl project. \n1. Repeater\nCreate a new HTML page that, when opened, will repeat a message. Ask the user to enter a message, and then ask them how many times they would like to repeat it. Display the output.\n2. Dice Roll\nCreate a new HTML page that, when opened, will display a message with a random number from 1-6.\nMany-sided Die\nBefore displaying the random number, ask the user how many choices should be available for the dice roll. There should be no limit to the number of sides on the die. For example, if the user says \"12\", the program should display a random number from 1-12.\nVisual Die\nCreate another new HTML page where, instead of simply displaying the number, it displays a visual representation of the die. For example, a roll of 2 would display \"X X \", a roll of 5 would display \"X X X X X \", and so on.\n3. Random Password\nCreate a new HTML page that will generate a numeric random password for the user. First, ask the user how many characters they would like for the password (1-16). Then, generate the password for them! The password should consist of only numeric characters.\nNon-numeric Password\nCreate another HTML page that will generate a random password consisting of alphanumeric characters. Ask the user how many characters they would like for the password (1-8). Then, generate the password for them! The password should consist of only lowercase letters.\n4. Division with Quotient and Remainder\nCreate another HTML page that will calculate the quotient AND remainder for two numbers. Ask the user to enter the two numbers (the dividend and divisor) and then display the quotient and remainder. For example, if the user enters \"15\" for the dividend, and \"7\" for the divisor, the program should output \"7 R 1\". You can use this tool to test your math.\n5. Multiply by 2\nCreate another HTML page that will multiply a given number by 2, with one catch: do not use +, -, /, or *. Ask the user for a number to multiply, and then perform the calculation. For example, if the user enters \"6\", the program should display \"12\".\nMultiply by a Power of 2\nInstead of multiplying by 2 every time, ask the user for a power of 2 to multiply by. For example, if the user enters \"5\" for the number, and \"2\" for the power of 2, the program should perform the calculation 5 times (2^2), which reduces to 5 times 4, and display \"20\". In this example, the ^ symbol represents an exponent. If the user enters \"9\" for the number and \"9\" for the power of 2, the program should perform the calculation 9 times (2^9) and display \"4608\".\n6. Regular Expressions\nClick here to access the tutorial covering regular expressions.\nThen, create another HTML page that will test a string against a regular expression. For example, if the user entered Hello for the string, and ello for the regular expression, the program should display true. If the user entered Hello for the string, and ello2 for the regular expression, the program should display false.\n"},"Week04/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"Week04/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 4 - Buttons","keywords":"","body":"Buttons\nLearn how to define functions that make buttons do things on a webpage!\nPowerPoint Presentation\n\n\nCode-Along: Darth Vader Soundboard\nClick here for the code-along instructions.\nSelf-Paced Work: Soundboard Updates\nClick here for the self-paced work instructions.\nChallenges\nClick here for some additional challenges.\nPast Session Recording\n\n"},"Week04/SoundboardCodeAlong.html":{"url":"Week04/SoundboardCodeAlong.html","title":"Code-Along","keywords":"","body":"Code-Along: Darth Vader \"Sound\"board\nCreate a new webpage featuring buttons that will say some Darth Vader quotes.\n\nClick here for an example of a real soundboard\nClick here for Darth Vader quote source\n\nStart by forking this starter Repl.

This is a small example of what is possible with chatbots.\nBasic Setup\nTo get started, fork this Repl project. It contains some basic HTML and CSS, but no JavaScript yet! Manually adding some of the basic starter code will be helpful practice.\nAdd a new JavaScript file to the Repl project, and link it from the index.html file.\n\nIn the Files area of the Repl, click the \"Add file\" button\nName the new file script.js\nOpen the index.html file for editing\nBetween the  and , under the , make a new line\nThere, add a  element\nSet the src attribute of the script to script.js\n\nThe added HTML should look something like this:\n\n\nFunction & Button\nNext, it's time to define a JavaScript function, and hook it up to a button in HTML.\nDefining the Function\nStart by defining the function.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nAdd code to define a function named chat\nKeyword: function\nFunction name: chat\nParentheses: ()\nCurly brackets: {}\n\n\nIn the body of the function (between { and }), make a new line\nAdd an alert statement that says \"Welcome to the Friend Proxy Chatbot!\"\n\nThe code in the script.js file should look something like this:\nfunction chat() {\n    alert(\"Welcome to the Friend Proxy Chatbot!\");\n}\n\nNow the function is defined, but there is no way to run it yet!\nCreating the Button\nCreate a button and hook it up to the function.\n\nOpen the index.html file for editing\nBetween the  and , under the , make a new line\nThere, add a  element\nSet the onclick attribute of the button to call the chat function\nchat()\n\n\nMake the text of the button say \"Chat\"\n\nThe added HTML should look something like this:\nChat\n\nRun the code. Click the \"Chat\" button on the page, and verify that a message appears!\nPrompt for Message\nNow, all new changes for the site will happen in the script.js file, within the chat function body. Start by prompting for the user to enter a message.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nMake a new line between the { and }, under the alert statement\nCreate a new variable named message\nSet the message variable to a prompt\nMake the text for the prompt say \"Please enter a message...\"\n\nThe added JavaScript should look something like this:\nlet message = prompt(\"Please enter a message...\");\n\nRun the code. Click the button, and verify that a prompt appears asking for a message. Nothing should happen when entering a message yet though!\nResponding to the Message\nNext, the chatbot should respond to certain messages the user enters. This is where if statements come in: the response should be different depending on the message.\nTo start, have the chatbot respond to a message of \"Hello\" from the user.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nMake a new line between the { and }, under the message variable\nThere, create an if statement\nKeyword: if\nParentheses: ()\nCurly brackets: {}\n\n\nFor the if condition, check if the user said \"Hello\"\nCondition goes between the parentheses\nUse message variable, ===, and \"Hello\" to compare\n\n\nIn the body of the if, display a message saying \"Well hi there!\"\nBody is between the curly brackets\nUse alert(\"Well hi there!\");\n\n\n\nThe added JavaScript should look something like this:\nif (message === \"Hello\") {\n    alert(\"Well hi there!\");\n}\n\nRun the code. Click the button, enter \"Hello\" as the message, and verify that the proper response appears! If any other message is entered, no response should appear.\nMore Responses\nThe chatbot is functional, but it is not very powerful yet. It needs to be able to respond to some more messages! Add a couple more responses using if statements.\n\n\n\nMessage\nResponse\n\n\n\n\nI love you\nThat's nice\n\n\nAre you my friend?\nYes, of course...\n\n\n\nThese if statements will look very similar to the previous if statement. For each of the responses, follow these steps:\n\nHave the script.js file open for editing\nMake a new line at the bottom of the chat body (above })\nAdd an if statement: if () {}\nFor the condition (between ( and )), check if message === the given message\nIn the body (between { and }), alert with the response\n\nThe added JavaScript should look something like this:\nif (message === \"I love you\") {\n    alert(\"That's nice\");\n}\n\nif (message === \"Are you my friend?\") {\n    alert(\"Yes, of course...\");\n}\n\nRun the code.

While this works, the user experience is less than ideal. A better way to communicate with users is through the HTML itself, by using DOM Manipulation. Using DOM manipulation is the next step toward creating a truly dynamic web experience.\nAfter reading through this guide, you should be able to use JavaScript to read from existing HTML elements.\nBefore that, though, let's start with some background information.\nBackground\nThis information will help inform the steps required to read from inputs.\nWhat is the DOM?\nThe Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.\nRepresenting HTML Elements in JavaScript\nSo far, we have stored a few different things in JavaScript variables: Numbers, Strings, and Booleans. These are known as Data Types. To store something bigger, like a whole HTML input element, we need to use another data type: Object. Objects in JavaScript can store pretty much anything! For now, we are going to use them to store HTML elements that exist in our HTML document.\nImplementation\nNow, let's cover how we will actually use these concepts to make our webpages more interactive!\nStoring an HTML Element in a JavaScript Variable\nTo find an element within our HTML page and store it in a variable, we use the document.querySelector function. This allows us to select an HTML element in the same way we would select it to style it in CSS. Note that here, we are storing the ACTUAL HTML ELEMENT, not just the text!\nLet's take a look at an example. Here's some HTML which includes an  element:\n\n    \n        Input your message: \n    \n\n\nTo select that element in JavaScript, and store it in a variable, you can do this:\nlet myInputElement = document.querySelector(\"#my-input\");\n\n\nNotice the text between the quotes in the JS: #my-input. This is exactly what we would use in CSS to select and style the input with an id of \"myInput\"\n\nHere, our document.querySelector code allows us to grab that whole HTML  element, and store it in the myInputElement variable. Once we have our HTML element stored in the variable, we can interact with it! We can use .value to get and set the text entered into the actual text box on the page.\nLet's take a look at an example, following from above. The HTML will be the same; the only important part is the  with that particular id attribute value:\n\n\nNow, to get the value of that text within JavaScript code, it looks like this:\nlet myInputElement = document.querySelector(\"#my-input\");\nlet myInputText = myInputElement.value;\n\n// This would display a pop-up where the message is whatever the user had typed into the text box!\nalert(`Your message was: ${myInputText}`);\n\nIt is also possible to set the text in the text box! The .value is set just like another variable. It could look something like this:\nlet myInputElement = document.querySelector(\"#my-input\");\nlet myInputText = myInputElement.value;\n\n// This will set the text inside the text box to \"my message\"\nmyInputElement.value = \"my message\";\n\nIt may also be desired to clear out the value; that's possible too!\nlet myInputElement = document.querySelector(\"#my-input\");\nlet myInputText = myInputElement.value;\n\n// This will clear out any text in the text box\nmyInputElement.value = \"\";\n\nConclusion\nIt may be difficult to grasp the concept of the DOM, but it is an incredibly powerful tool. It can allow you to create truly interactive user experiences!\n"},"Week06/MadLibsCodeAlong.html":{"url":"Week06/MadLibsCodeAlong.html","title":"Code-Along","keywords":"","body":"Code-Along: Mad Libs Redux\nCreate a webpage that will allow the user to enter some individual words and tell a silly story.\n\nFor this activity, start with the first sentence of the text:\n\nPizza was invented by a ___adjective___ ___nationality___ chef named ___person___.\n\nPart 1 - Basic Setup\nStart by forking this empty Repl, then follow the steps below.\n\nOpen the index.html file for editing\nAdd the basic elements: , , \nCreate a new JavaScript file named script.js\nLink the JavaScript file in the HTML file using a  element\n\nPart 2 - Creating the Inputs in HTML\nThe next step is to create some text boxes in the HTML that will appear on the webpage.\n\nIn the index.html file, create a header for the webpage that says \"Pizza Pizza\"\nUnder that, create a  element containing a text label that says \"Adjective\"\nWithin that  element, after the text, create an  element\nEnsure that the  has an id attribute\n\n\nCreate additional  elements containing labels and inputs for \"Nationality\" and \"Person\"\n\nAt this point, the code in the index.html file should look something like this:\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n        Pizza Pizza\n        Adjective: \n        Nationality: \n        Person: \n    \n\n\nPart 3 - Defining the Function in JavaScript\nThe next step is to define a function that will put the story together.

Button-based Calculator\nCreate a button-based calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.\nButtons\nThe HTML for the calculator should consist of many buttons:\n\nOne button for each numeric digit (0-9)\nOne button for open and close parenthesis: ( and )\nOne button for each basic math operator: +, -, /, and *\nOne button to perform the final calculation: =\n\nInput\nThere should be one HTML  storing the running equation.\nFunctionality\nThis is what everything should do.\nCharacter Buttons\nWhen any button other than the = button is clicked, the program should add that character to the running equation. Additionally, the program should display the current equation in the HTML input. For example, if the \"2\" button is pressed, the program should display \"2\". Then, if the \"+\" button is pressed, the program should display \"2+\". Then, if the \"1\" button is pressed, the program should display \"2+1\".\nEquals Button\nWhen the = button is pressed, the program should:\n\nDisplay the result of the equation in an alert\nEx, if the equation is \"2+1\", display \"3\"\n\n\nClear the current equation\n\n4. March Madness\nCreate an HTML page to represent a bracket (like March Madness). Start with a simplified Final Four bracket, with four inputs, each feeding into the tournament:\n\nThe user should be able to enter four teams for each Final Four spot. There should be a button to simulate a bracket situation by randomizing the winners of each game. The page should fill in the remaining bracket inputs with the randomized results.\nExtra Challenge - More Teams\nIf the Final Four functionality works, add in the previous round of the bracket surrounding the Final Four: the Elite Eight. There should be eight inputs where the user can enter team names, and the page should randomize results for each game.\nExtra Challenge - Seeding probability\nThe page should take into account the seeds of each team during the simulation. Add a small additional input field next to each team input. The page should use these seeds to make it more likely that a lower seed will randomly win the game.\n"},"Week07/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"Week07/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 7 - DOM Manipulation (Update HTML)","keywords":"","body":"DOM Manipulation (Update HTML)\nLearn how to update the HTML elements on a webpage using JavaScript.\nPowerPoint Presentation\n\n\nDOM Manipulation Guide: Update HTML\nClick here to for a guide on using JavaScript to update HTML elements.\nCode-Along: Lyrics Builder\nClick here for the code-along instructions.\nSelf-Paced Work: Background Changer\nClick here for the self-paced work instructions.\nChallenges\nThere are a couple different challenges:\n\nClick here for the Shopping List challenge\nClick here for the Table Data challenge\n\nPast Session Recording\n\n"},"Week07/LyricsCodeAlong.html":{"url":"Week07/LyricsCodeAlong.html","title":"Code-Along","keywords":"","body":"Code-Along: Lyrics Builder\nThe goal of this activity is to create a webpage that will allow the user to enter lyrics into a text box line-by-line, and then display them in a nice container.

Fork this Repl project to begin. Then, follow the instructions below!\nPart 1 - Adding Content Tags\nFirst, add the elements that will make up the page. Open up the index.html file, and add each of these elements within the :\n\nAn  for \"Lyrics\"\nA  for the container where the lyrics will go\nAnother  for \"Add Line\"\nFinally, another  containing:\nA text \nA  that says \"Add\"\n\n\n\nThe code between  and  should look something like this:\nLyrics\n\nAdd Line\n\n    \n    Add\n\n\nPart 2 - Adding IDs\nIt will be necessary to provide id attributes for the HTML elements that are to be manipulated in JavaScript. These elements are the lyrics container  and the text box .\n\n\n\nElement\nid attribute value\n\n\n\n\nLyrics Container \nlyrics-container\n\n\nAdd Line \nline-text\n\n\n\nThe updated code in the  in index.html should look something like this:\nLyrics\n\nAdd Line\n\n    \n    Add\n\n\nPart 3 - Styling the Lyrics Box\nCurrently, the  that will contain the lyrics doesn't have any content, so it won't show up on the page. Add some CSS to select the  and style it so it appears!\n\nOpen the style.css file for editing\nCreate a new ruleset, and select the Lyrics Container by its id value\n#lyrics-container { }\n\n\nSet some properties within the ruleset:\nborder: 1px dotted black;\nheight: 500px;\nwidth: 500px;\npadding: 10px\n\n\n\nThe code in the style.css file should look something like this:\n#lyrics-container {\n    border: 1px dotted black;\n    height: 500px;\n    width: 500px;\n    padding: 10px;\n}\n\nRun the program, and verify that the  now appears with a dotted black outline!\nPart 4 - Button Function\nNow that the HTML is setup, the only thing left to do is make it work! Start by hooking up the button.\nJavaScript\nIn the script.js file, define a function that will execute when the user clicks our \"Add\" button. The function should be named addLine. There are four pieces of a basic function definition:\n\nfunction keyword\nFunction name addLine\nParentheses (left/right)\nCurly brackets (left/right)\n\nThe code in the script.js file should look something like this:\nfunction addLine() {\n\n}\n\nHTML\nNext, in the index.html file, add an onclick attribute to the  that will call the addLine function. The code should look something like this:\nAdd\n\nNow when the user clicks the \"Add\" button on the page, the code within the addLine function will run!\nPart 5 - Getting Text from the \nWhenever the user clicks \"Add\", the program should look at the text within the line-text input.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nIn the body of the addLine function, create a new variable named lineTextInput\nSet the variable to be a call to document.querySelector(\"\")\nFor the selector string, select the Line Text input by its id value (line-text)\n\nCreating this variable should look something like this in JavaScript:\nlet lineTextInput = document.querySelector(\"#line-text\");\n\nNotice the selector string used here: \"#line-text\". After the  element is stored in a variable, it will be necessary to use .value to retrieve the text that has been entered into the field.\n\nMake a new line under the lineTextInput variable\nCreate a new variable named lineText\nSet it equal to the .value of the lineTextInput variable\n\nCreating this variable should look something like this:\nlet lineText = lineTextInput.value;\n\nNow, the text the user entered will be stored in the lineText variable!\nPart 6 - Creating the New  Element\nNow that the text has been retrieved, it will be possible to create a new paragraph and place the text in it.\n\nAt the bottom of the addLine function, make a couple new lines\nCreate a new variable named nextLine\nSet the variable to be a call to document.createElement(\"\")\nPass in p for the tag name string\n\nCreating this variable should look something like this:\nlet nextLine = document.createElement(\"p\");\n\nNext, properly set the text value of this new paragraph element. This is possible with .textContent:\nnextLine.textContent = lineText;\n\nThe new element has been created and fully formed!\nPart 7 - Inserting the New  Element into the \nThe new paragraph exists, but it will not appear on the webpage until it is inserted somewhere. It should go in the Lyrics Container .\n\nAt the bottom of the addLine function, make some new lines\ncreate a new variable named lyricsContainer\nSet the variable to be a call to document.querySelector(\"\")\nFor the selector string, select the Line Text input by its id value (lyrics-container)\n\nThe code to store this HTML element should look something like this:\nlet lyricsContainer = document.querySelector(\"#lyrics-container\");\n\nNotice the selector string used here: \"#lyrics-container\". Now that the  element is stored in the lyricsContainer variable, it will be possible to insert the newly-created paragraph element into it! This is possible with .appendChild:\nlyricsContainer.appendChild(nextLine);\n\nNow, the button on the page is clicked, it should create a new paragraph using the text from the text box and add it to the Lyrics Container!\nPart 8 - Clearing the Input\nThe last thing needed is to clear out the value of the  after a line has been added. To accomplish this, set .value of the  to the empty string (\"\"):\nlineTextInput.value = \"\";\n\nAnd that's it! At this point, the Lyrics Builder should be fully functional! Test it out to make sure everything is working.\nFinal Code\nThe final code should look something like this:\nindex.html\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        Lyrics\n        \n        Add Line\n        \n            \n            Add\n        \n    \n\n\nscript.js\nfunction addLine() {\n    let lineTextInput = document.querySelector(\"#line-text\");\n    let lineText = lineTextInput.value;\n    let nextLine = document.createElement(\"p\");\n    nextLine.textContent = lineText;\n\n    let lyricsContainer = document.querySelector(\"#lyrics-container\");\n    lyricsContainer.appendChild(nextLine);\n\n    lineTextInput.value = \"\";\n}\n\n"},"Week07/SelfPacedWork.html":{"url":"Week07/SelfPacedWork.html","title":"Self-Paced Work","keywords":"","body":"Self-Paced Work: Background Changer Revisited\nPreviously, there was a webpage that could change its background color on a button click.

The task at hand is to add buttons so that it is possible to roll other types of dice as well.\nBackground Information - Random Number Generation\nRandom numbers can be an extremely useful tool when creating games. Any time there is any sort of probability in a game, it's probably using random numbers!\nMath.random()\nIn JavaScript, Math.random() is used to generate a random decimal number between 0 and 1.\nExpanding the Range\nTo make the Math.random() number a little more usable, it can be multiplied by however many options are desired For example, Math.random() * 5 would return a random decimal number between 0 and 5, Math.random() * 100 would return a random decimal number between 0 and 100, and so on. A regular die has 6 sides, so initially, the number should be multiplied by 6.\nLimiting the Numbers to Integers with Math.floor()\nIn this case, the goal is to generate integers. A die has a certain number of integer sides, so decimals do not really make sense. To round down a decimal number, Math.floor() can be used. This function will round any decimal number DOWN to the nearest whole number. For example, given 0.01, it would return 0. Given 11.9, it would return 11. Given 5.0, it would return 5, because 5 is already a whole number.\nAfter rounding the number down, it is necessary to add 1; this shifts the range from 0 through 5 to 1 through 6 (inclusive).\nWhen applied to the randomly-generated number from a given range, it is possible to reach all the sides for a die! Now, make some updates to our code to make good use of these random numbers.\nPart 1 - Getting Started\nBegin by forking this starter project.\nPart 2 - A 4-sided Die Roll\nNow it's time to start expanding this application. The first thing to do is add another die - this time, one with four sides. Add a button in the HTML, and make it call a JavaScript function that displays a random number between 1 and 4.\nHTML - Adding a Button\nStart by updating the HTML.\n\nOpen the index.html file for editing\nAbove the existing  in the , add another \nMake the text for this new button say D4\nSet the onclick attribute of the new button to call a function named rollD4\nThis function has yet to be defined - that's next!\n\n\n\nThe additional HTML should look something like this:\nD4\n\nJavaScript - Button Functionality\nNext, it's time to define the function in JavaScript.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nUnder the existing function definition, define a new function named rollD4\nfunction keyword\nFunction name: rollD4\nParentheses (left/right)\nCurly brackets (left/right)\n\n\n\n\nIn the body of the new function (between { and }), type out the statements from the rollD6 function\nThis function will be very similar...\n\n\nChange the randomDecimalRange variable so that it multiplies the randomDecimal by 4 instead of 6\nThis will allow for a range between 1 and 4\n\n\n\nThe new function should look something like this:\nfunction rollD4() {\n  let randomDecimal = Math.random();\n  let randomDecimalRange = randomDecimal * 4;\n  let randomIntegerFloored = Math.floor(randomDecimalRange);\n  let randomDiceRoll = randomIntegerFloored + 1;\n    let message = `You rolled a ${randomDiceRoll}!`;\n\n  alert(message);\n}\n\nLoad up the page, and click the new \"D4\" button a few times to make sure it is working properly!\nPart 3 - A D8 Roll\nNext, add another button and function for an 8-sided die. This should be very similar to the steps above! Copy the HTML  code with different text and a different function call, and then copy the rollD4 function and change the name and randomDecimalRange multiplication factor.\nThe HTML should look something like this:\nD8\n\nAnd the JavaScript should look something like this:\nfunction rollD8() {\n  let randomDecimal = Math.random();\n  let randomDecimalRange = randomDecimal * 8;\n  let randomIntegerFloored = Math.floor(randomDecimalRange);\n  let randomDiceRoll = randomIntegerFloored + 1;\n    let message = `You rolled a ${randomDiceRoll}!`;\n\n  alert(message);\n}\n\nTry out the \"D8\" button, and make sure it works!\nIt should be function, but it is evident that this is becoming a little tedious. If there were a bunch of different types of dice, the code would become pretty difficult to manage. Luckily, there is a better way: function parameters!\nPart 4 - Function Parameters\nSince there is only one small part of the functions that differ for different dice rolls, it will be possible to use a single function and a parameter instead! This allows the project to cut down on repeated code, and makes it easier for anyone to change the mechanics for all dice rolls.\nUpdating the Function Definition\nTo add a parameter, place a new variable name within the parentheses of the function definition, like this:\nfunction rollD8(sides) { /* ... */ }\n\nAfter that, the sides variable will be accessible inside of the body of the function. The value of the sides variable will be whatever is passed when the function is called (the argument). That can be used to determine the multiplication factor for the roll range.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nAdd the sides parameter to the rollD8 function definition\nAdd sides within the parentheses right after the function name\n\n\nIn the body of the rollD8 function, replace the 8 with sides\nThe range of the die roll will be based on this instead of just 8!\n\n\nTo reflect the new functionality, change the name of the function to simply rollD\n\nAt this point, the function definition should look something like this:\nfunction rollD(sides) {\n  let randomDecimal = Math.random();\n  let randomDecimalRange = randomDecimal * sides;\n  let randomIntegerFloored = Math.floor(randomDecimalRange);\n  let randomDiceRoll = randomIntegerFloored + 1;\n    let message = `You rolled a ${randomDiceRoll}!`;\n\n  alert(message);\n}\n\nUpdating the Function Call\nNow that the function definition has been updated, the function call to rollD8 will be broken! In the HTML file, update the \"D8\" button so that it works.\n\nOpen the index.html file for editing\nFind the  for D8\nIn the onclick attribute, update the function name\nInstead of rollD8, it should simply be rollD\n\n\nWithin the function call parentheses, pass in the number of sides\nThis should be 8\n\n\n\nThe updated button in the HTML should look something like this:\nD8\n\nUpdating the Function Calls for Other Dice\nThe big benefit of this new parameter is that it is now possible to update the other function calls too!\nFor each button in the index.html file:\n\nUpdate the function name within the onclick attribute so it is simply rollD\nBetween the function call parentheses, pass in the appropriate number of sides\ne.g., 6 for the D6 button\n\n\n\nThe HTML should end up looking something like this:\nD4\nD6\nD8\n\nIt should now be possible to remove all the other function definitions from the script.js file; all that is needed is the generic rollD function! Once this is done, test out all the buttons to make sure they still work.\nAdding a D20\nIt is now incredibly easy to add a new die. Simply create a new button, and call the rollD function with the appropriate parameter. Add a D20 button to the page!\n\nOpen the index.html file for editing\nUnder the last  in the , add another \nSet the text of the  to be D20\nSet the onclick of the  to call the rollD function\nPass in 20 as the argument between the parentheses\n\nThe new HTML button should look something like this:\nD20\n\nTest out the D20 button, and make sure it works as intended! Notice that no JavaScript updates are necessary; the parameter makes the code flexible enough to work with new values.\nPart 5 - Using DOM Manipulation to Display the Dice Roll\nNext, it's time to update our function so that instead of using an alert to show the roll result to the user, it updates the text of a paragraph on the HTML page. If there were multiple functions for each die, it would be necessary to update all of those functions individually. Luckily, because of function parameters, only one function definition will need updating!\nHTML - Adding a Paragraph\nThe first step will be to add a new paragraph that will be able to hold the roll result.\n\nOpen the index.html file for editing\nUnder the last  in the , add a \nGive the  a unique id attribute: display-roll\n\nThe added HTML should look something like this:\n\n\nNote that the paragraph should be empty at this point, and will not display anything... yet!\nJavaScript - Setting the Paragraph Text\nNow that the paragraph exists in the HTML, it will be necessary to set its text programmatically, based on the result of the randomized dice roll.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nIn the body of the rollD function, remove the alert\nMake a new line in the body, and create a variable named displayPara\nSet the displayPara variable to be a call to document.querySelector(\"\")\nBetween the quotes, pass in the id selector for the paragraph: #display-roll\n\n\nOn the next line, set the .textContent of the displayPara element\nIt should be set to the message variable value\n\n\n\nThe JavaScript replacing the alert statement should look something like this:\nlet displayPara = document.querySelector(\"#display-roll\");\ndisplayPara.textContent = message;\n\nLoad up the page, click the buttons, and verify that the new functionality works as intended. The code should update the text directly on the page!\nAdding D120\nAgain, it is now much simpler to add an additional die roll button. For a D120, just add a new  in the HTML that calls the rollD function with 120 as the argument value! It is possible to add a die with any number of sides.\nFinal Result\nAt the end of this activity, the code should look something like this:\nindex.html\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n    \n    Dice\n        D4\n        D6\n        D8\n        D20\n    D120\n    \n    \n\n\nscript.js\nfunction rollD(sides) {\n  let randomDecimal = Math.random();\n  let randomDecimalRange = randomDecimal * sides;\n  let randomIntegerFloored = Math.floor(randomDecimalRange);\n  let randomDiceRoll = randomIntegerFloored + 1;\n    let message = `You rolled a ${randomDiceRoll}!`;\n\n  let displayPara = document.querySelector(\"#display-roll\");\n    displayPara.textContent = message;\n}\n\n"},"Week08/SelfPacedWork.html":{"url":"Week08/SelfPacedWork.html","title":"Self-Paced Work","keywords":"","body":"Self-Paced Work: Background Images\nFollow the instructions below to create a webpage that allows the user to change the background image dynamically.

In the style.css file, use the following code:\nbody {\n    background: url(Planet.jpg);\n}\n\nThis is the ruleset that will be updated with JavaScript when buttons are clicked.\nPart 2 - One Button\nAdd a button that will set the background image when clicked.\nJavaScript\nStart by defining a function in JavaScript.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nAt the top of the file, define a new function named changeBackground\nfunction keyword\nFunction name: changeBackground\nParentheses (left/right)\nCurly brackets (left/right)\n\n\nIn the body of the function (between { and }), make a new line\nOn the new line, add the code to update the background image to Pokemon.jpg\n\nNow the function should be defined... but it needs to be called!\nHTML\nAdd a button in the HTML to call the newly-defined function.\n\nOpen the index.html file for editing\nWithin the , create a  element\nMake the text for the button be Image 1\nSet the onclick of the  to call the changeBackground function\nUse the function name and parentheses (left/right)\n\n\n\nAt this point, load up the page and try clicking the button. The background image should update!\nPart 3 - Two Buttons\nNow, create another HTML  and JavaScript function that will change the background to another image. This will be very similar to the steps above!\nJavaScript\nIn the script.js function, define a new function named changeBackground2. It should be almost exactly the same as the changeBackground function, except that it should set the background URL to City.jpg.\nHTML\nIn the index.html file, create a new . Place it under the existing , within the . It should be almost exactly the same as the other , but the text should be Image 2 and the onclick attribute should call the changeBackground2 function.\nOnce the functional button has been added, load up the page and click it. It should change the background to the new image!\nPart 4 - Parameter Time\nAt this point, the script.js file should contain two very similar functions. The only differences are the names of the functions, and the actual filenames for the images. Looks like a parameter could help simplify this code!\nUpdating the Function Definition\nStart by changing one of the existing function definitions so that it uses a parameter.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nIn the changeBackground function definition, add a parameter named backgroundUrl\nIt should go in between the parentheses right after the function name\n\n\nIn the body of the changeBackground function, replace Pokemon.jpg with the variable value of the parameter\nUsing a template literal, it should look something like this:  `url(${backgroundUrl})`;`\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the function has been redefined, which means it can set the background to any image!\nUpdating the Function Calls\nRedefining the function means that the function call is currently broken. Update each function call so they each pass in an argument.\n\nOpen the index.html file for editing\nFind the  where the onclick attribute calls the changeBackground function\nUpdate this call by placing 'Pokemon.jpg' between the parentheses - this will be the argument\nNote that the argument value should be surrounded by single quotes; this is because the attribute is within double quotes\n\n\nUpdate the second  to call changeBackground and pass in 'City.jpg' as the argument\n\nNow try loading up the page. Click each button and verify that they still work as intended!\nAt this point, it will be possible to remove the changeBackground2 function; it should not be needed any longer.\nPart 5 - Three Buttons\nIn addition to refactoring the other buttons, adding this parameter makes it much simpler to add another new button! Note that no changes in the script.js file are required.\n\nOpen the index.html file for editing\nWithin the , under the existing s, create a new  element\nMake the text for the button be Image 3\nSet the onclick of the  to call the changeBackground function\nUse the function name and parentheses (left/right)\n\n\nPass in an argument of 'CalvinAndHobbes.jpg' to the function\n\nLoad up the page again, click the third button, and verify that the background changes to yet another new image! All this without changing anything in the JavaScript ๐\nChallenge 1 - Prompt for Image\nTry to expand the functionality of the page by adding a button that, when clicked, will prompt the user for a URL, and set the background image to whatever they enter.\nJavaScript\nStart by defining a new function in the JavaScript.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nUnder the existing function, define a new function named promptForBg\nIn the body of the promptForBg function, use a prompt to ask the user what they want the background to be\nMake sure to store their answer in a variable\n\n\nUnder that prompt, call the changeBackground function and pass in the value the user entered as the argument\n\nThat should do it for the JavaScript!\nHTML\nTo actually use the promptForBg function, it will be necessary to add a button to the page.\n\nOpen the index.html file for editing\nIn the , under the existing s, add a new \nMake the text for the button be Image from Prompt\nSet the onclick attribute for the  to call the promptForBg function\nNote that it is not necessary to pass in a URL here; the function will take care of that with the prompt!\n\n\n\nLoad up the page, click the button, and verify that a new URL can be entered! Try to find an image somewhere online and copy its URL for fun custom backgrounds!\nThis is a good example of reusing code to implement new features. By calling the changeBackground function, it was possible to avoid unnecessary code duplication!\nChallenge 2 - Input for Image\nFinally, expand the functionality a little more by creating a button that will set the background image based on an input on the page.\nHTML\nStart by updating the HTML with the necessary elements.\n\nOpen the index.html file for editing\nIn the , under the  elements, create a new  element\nWithin the , create a new  element\nSet the type attribute of the  element to be \"text\"\nSet the id attribute of the  element to be bg-input\nUnder the  element, still within the , create a \nMake the text for the  be Image from Input\n\nNow the elements should all be in place - but the button needs something to do!\nJavaScript\nDefine a new function to set the background image based on the new text box element.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nUnder the existing function, define a new function named inputForBg\nIn the body of the inputForBg function, create a new variable named bgInputElement\nSet the variable to be a call to the document.querySelector function\nIt should select the  from the HTML based on its id\n\n\nUnder that, create another new variable named bgInputValue\nSet that variable to be the .value of the bgInputElement variable\nUnder that, call the changeBackground function, and pass in the bgInputValue variable as the argument\nUnder that, set the .value of the bgInputElement variable to be empty (\"\")\n\nThat should be it for the JavaScript! The function is defined and ready to go... it just needs to be called from the HTML.\nBack to the HTML\nUpdate the new button so that it does the right thing.\n\nOpen the index.html file for editing\nFind the  element with the text Image from Input\nSet the onclick attribute for that  to call the inputForBg function\n\nThat's it! Load up the page, enter a URL into the text box, and click the button. The new background image should appear, and the text box should go back to being empty!\n"},"Week08/Challenges.html":{"url":"Week08/Challenges.html","title":"Challenges","keywords":"","body":"Challenges: Various Functions\nCreate a webpage where users can perform various functions on two inputs.\nSetup\nStart by forking this empty Repl, then follow the steps below.\nBasics\nDo some initial setup to begin.\n\nCreate a new script.js file\nUpdate the index.html file with the basic starter code\n, , , \n\n\nAlso in the index.html file:\nCreate two text , each with a unique id\nCreate a  with a unique id\nCreate a  with the text \"Add\"\n\n\n\nFirst Button\nMake the button add the two numbers from the inputs together, and display the result on the page.\n\nIn the script.js file, define a function named addNumbers\nIn the body of the addNumbers function:\nRetrieve the text values from the two text  in the HTML\nConvert the text values into numbers\nAdd the two numbers together\nRetrieve the  from the HTML\nSet the paragraph's text to be the result of the calculation\nClear the text  values\n\n\nIn the index.html file, set the onclick attribute of the button to call the addNumbers function\n\nSecond Button\nRepeat the steps above for a new function: multiplyNumbers. Add a new  to the HTML, and test out both of the buttons.\nAbstracting the Functionality\nSo far, it has been possible to execute two functions on the two input values. Expand this to make it easier to add more functions, without repeating a lot of code.\nSimplifying Functions\nThe addNumbers and multiplyNumbers functions are doing too much right now. In general, functions should do as little as possible, so repeated code is not necessary.\nSimplify the addNumbers and multiplyNumbers functions. They should:\n\nTake in the text values as parameters\nConvert the values to numbers\nPerform the calculation\nReturn the result of the calculation\n\nRunner Function\nThe next step is to create a runner function that will call all other functions as needed. Each button should be identifiable by a number. The runner function will call the corresponding function.\n\nIn the script.js file, define a function named runButton\nIn the body of the runButton function:\nTake in a numeric parameter representing which function to call\nRetrieve the text values from the two text s in the HTML\nCall the appropriate function, passing the text values as parameters\nE.g., if the numeric parameter is 1, call addNumbers. If the numeric parameter is 2, call multiplyNumbers.\n\n\nSet the paragraph's text to the result of the function call\nClear the text input values\n\n\n\nFor example, say the \"Add\" button is 1, and the \"Multiply\" button is 2. Calling runButton(1) should perform the addNumbers action, and calling runButton(2) should perform the multiplyNumbers. Note that these identifiers are completely arbitrary. Any sort of parameter works, as long as the runButton calls the right function!\nUpdating Function Calls\nNow, the runButton function should be able to handle any of the buttons! Update the onclick attribute for each button so that they each call runButton with the appropriate numeric identifier.\nAdding New Buttons\nNow, it should be possible to add a new buttons for new calculations.\nTo add a new button and function:\n\nIn the script.js file, define a new function that will take in two values as parameters, and return the result\nCall this function within the runButton function based on its numeric identifier (e.g., 3)\nIn the index.html file, create a new button that will call runButton with the numeric identifier as the parameter (e.g., 3)\n\nThat's all! Try to create buttons that will perform the following actions:\n\nDivide the two inputs\nSay whether or not the two inputs are equal (return a string)\nReturn the larger input\nReturn the average of the two inputs\nReturn the larger input minus the smaller input\n\nMore Functions - Single Input\nTry to think of possible calculations to perform on a single input. Try playing this function game for inspiration.\n"},"Week09/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"Week09/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 9 - JavaScript Objects","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript Objects\nLearn how to use JavaScript Objects to store data more efficiently.
