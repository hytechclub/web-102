Start with , then add  and  between the HTML tags.\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\nAdd a Header\nBetween the opening and closing body tags, add an h3 element. Within the h3 element, add the proper text.\nDespicable Me Fan Site\n\nAdd an Image\nAdd an image to the page.\n\nGo to Google Images\nFind an image, and copy the image address/URL/location\nCreate an img tag, and set its src attribute to be the URL for the image\n\n\n\nAdd a Paragraph\nUnder the img element, add a p element that contains the text for the paragraph.\nDespicable Me is a great film filled with several memorable characters and zany plot lines.\n\nAdd Another Header\nUnder the p, add another h3 header that will serve as the title for a list.\nTop Three Movies Of All Time\n\nAdd a List\nUnder the h3, create an ol element. Between the opening and closing tags, create three li elements with the proper text.\n\n    Despicable Me\n    Despicable Me 2\n    Despicable Me 3\n\n\nCreate a New CSS File\nNow it's time to add some style. Create a new file named style.css, and save it in the same folder as the index.html file. In the file, add a ruleset that will select the body (all the content on the page). Within the ruleset, set the background property to black, and the color property to orange.\nbody {\n    background: black;\n    color: orange;\n}\n\nLink the CSS in the HTML\nAlthough CSS has been added to the style.css file, nothing has changed on the page! This is because the CSS file must be linked in the HTML file.\nIn the index.html file, between the opening and closing head tags, create a link tag. It should have an href attribute with the value style.css, a type attribute with the value text/css, and a rel attribute with the value stylesheet. Now the page should have the styles!\n\n\nAdd an Image Style\nCurrently, the image might be a little big. Use CSS to update its size. In the style.css file, add a ruleset that will select the img. Within the ruleset, set the height property to 200px.\nimg {\n    height: 200px;\n}\n\nAdd a Main Header Style\nNext, it would be nice for the main header to stand out a little more. To select this header specifically, but not any other header, add an id attribute to it in the HTML, and then select it by its ID in the CSS.\nIn the index.html file, find the top h3 header. Add an id attribute with a value of main to the element.\nDespicable Me Fan Site\n\nIn the style.css file, add a ruleset that will select elements with an ID of main using #main. Within the ruleset, set the color property to yellow (this is the color of the minions).\n#main {\n    color: yellow;\n}\n\nFinal Code\nThat's it!

Ask the user to enter a message, and then ask them how many times they would like to repeat it. Display the output.\nDice Roll\nCreate a new HTML page that, when opened, will display a message with a random number from 1-6.\nMany-sided Die\nBefore displaying the random number, ask the user how many choices should be available for the dice roll. There should be no limit to the number of sides on the die. For example, if the user says \"12\", the program should display a random number from 1-12.\nVisual Die\nCreate another new HTML page where, instead of simply displaying the number, it displays a visual representation of the die. For example, a roll of 2 would display \"X X \", a roll of 5 would display \"X X X X X \", and so on.\nRandom Password\nCreate a new HTML page that will generate a numeric random password for the user. First, ask the user how many characters they would like for the password (1-16). Then, generate the password for them! The password should consist of only numeric characters.\nNon-numeric Password\nCreate another HTML page that will generate a random password consisting of alphanumeric characters. Ask the user how many characters they would like for the password (1-8). Then, generate the password for them! The password should consist of only lowercase letters.\nDivision with Quotient and Remainder\nCreate another HTML page that will calculate the quotient AND remainder for two numbers. Ask the user to enter the two numbers (the dividend and divisor) and then display the quotient and remainder. For example, if the user enters \"15\" for the dividend, and \"7\" for the divisor, the program should output \"7 R 1\". You can use this tool to test your math: https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/longdivision.php\nMultiply by 2\nCreate another HTML page that will multiply a given number by 2, with one catch: do not use +, -, /, or *. Ask the user for a number to multiply, and then perform the calculation. For example, if the user enters \"6\", the program should display \"12\".\nMultiply by a Power of 2\nInstead of multiplying by 2 every time, ask the user for a power of 2 to multiply by. For example, if the user enters \"5\" for the number, and \"2\" for the power of 2, the program should perform the calculation 5 times (2^2), which reduces to 5 times 4, and display \"20\". In this example, the ^ symbol represents an exponent. If the user enters \"9\" for the number and \"9\" for the power of 2, the program should perform the calculation 9 times (2^9) and display \"4608\".\nRegular Expressions\nLearn about regular expressions with this tutorial: https://regexone.com/\nThen, create another HTML page that will test a string against a regular expression. For example, if the user entered \"Hello\" for the string, and \"ello\" for the regular expression, the program should display \"true\". If the user entered \"Hello\" for the string, and \"ello2\" for the regular expression, the program should display \"false\".\n"},"Week04/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"Week04/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 4 - Buttons","keywords":"","body":".js Files & Buttons\nLearn how to define functions in separate files that make buttons do things on a webpage.

For example, they should be able to enter either \"red\" or \"Red\", and the program should deal with the color in the same way.\nChange the Text Color\nAdd another button and function to change the text color on the page. It should work the same as the background color, taking in two colors and mixing them together.\nReusing Functionality\nFor an added challenge, reuse the code from the changeBackground function for changing the text color. Create a new function that simply calculates a mix color, and call that function for both the Background button and the Text Color button.\n"},"Week05/Challenges.html":{"url":"Week05/Challenges.html","title":"Challenges","keywords":"","body":"Booleans and Conditionals Challenges\nFirst, create a new HTML file and a new JS file.

While this works, the user experience is less than ideal. A better way to communicate with users is through the HTML itself, by using DOM Manipulation. Using DOM manipulation is the next step toward creating a truly dynamic web experience.\nAfter reading through this guide, you should be able to use JavaScript to read from existing HTML elements.\nBefore that, though, let's start with some background information.\nBackground\nWhat is the DOM?\nThe Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page. For more information, check out this article from Mozilla: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction\nRepresenting HTML Elements in JavaScript\nSo far, we have stored a few different things in JavaScript variables: Numbers, Strings, and Booleans. These are known as Data Types. To store something bigger, like a whole HTML input element, we need to use another data type: Object. Objects in JavaScript can store pretty much anything! For now, we are going to use them to store HTML elements that exist in our HTML document.\nImplementation\nNow, let's cover how we will actually use these concepts to make our webpages more interactive!\nStoring an HTML Element in a JavaScript Variable\nTo find an element within our HTML page and store it in a variable, we use document.querySelector. This allows us to select an HTML element in the same way we would select it to style it in CSS. Note that here, we are storing the ACTUAL HTML ELEMENT, not just the text!\nHTML\n\n    \n        Input your message: \n    \n\n\nJavaScript\nvar myMessageVariable = document.querySelector(\"#myInput\");\n\n\nNotice the text between the quotes in the JS: #myInput. This is exactly what we would use in CSS to select and style the input with an id of \"myInput\".\n\nHere, our document.querySelector code allows us to grab that whole HTML input element, and store it in the myMessageVariable variable. Once we have our HTML element stored in the variable, we can interact with it! We can use .value to get and set the text entered in the  tag like so:\nGetting the  Value\nvar myMessageVariable = document.querySelector(\"#myInput\");\nvar myMessageValue = myMessageVariable.value;\n\n// show a message with the contents of the #myInput input\nalert(\"Your message was: \" + myMessageValue);\n\n"},"Week06/MadLibsFollowAlong.html":{"url":"Week06/MadLibsFollowAlong.html","title":"Mad Libs Follow-Along","keywords":"","body":"Mad Libs Follow-Along\nCreate a webpage that will allow the user to enter some individual words and tell a silly story.\n\nBasic Setup\nStart from this empty Repl, then follow the steps below.\n\nOpen the index.html file\nAdd the basic tags: html, head, body\nCreate a new JavaScript file called MadLibs.js\nLink the JavaScript file in the HTML file using a script tag\n\nCreating the Inputs in HTML\n\nIn the HTML file, create an appropriate header for the webpage saying \"Pizza Pizza\"\nCreate a p paragraph element containing a text label and a textbox input for \"Adjective\"\nEnsure that the input element has an id attribute\n\n\nCreate additional p elements containing labels and inputs for \"Nationality\" and \"Person\"\n\nindex.html\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n        Pizza Pizza\n        Adjective: \n        Nationality: \n        Person: \n    \n\n\nDefining the Function in JavaScript\nIn the JavaScript file, define a new function named madLibs:\n\nfunction keyword\nfunction name (madLibs)\nparentheses (())\ncurly brackets ({})\n\nMadLibs.js\nfunction madLibs() {\n\n}\n\nGetting the Values from Inputs\nIn the body of the madLibs function:\n\nStore the\"Adjective\" input element in a variable\nnew variable (var adj1El =)\ndocument.querySelector()\nquotes (\"\")\nselector for the first input (#adj)\n\n\nStore the text from the input element in a variable\nnew variable (var adj1Val =)\nelement variable (adj1El)\n.value\n\n\nRepeat the above steps for each of the three inputs\n\nMadLibs.js\nvar adj1El = document.querySelector(\"#adj1\");\nvar adj1Val = adj1El.value;\n\nvar nationalityEl = document.querySelector(\"#nationality\");\nvar nationalityVal = nationalityEl.value;\n\nvar personEl = document.querySelector(\"#person\");\nvar personVal = personEl.value;\n\nDisplaying the Story\nCreate an alert and put the story together.

After reading through this guide, you should be able to use JavaScript to:\n\nUpdate existing HTML elements\nCreate new HTML elements\nAdd new HTML elements to your webpage\n\nGetting and Setting Paragraph Text\nIt is possible to read from existing paragraphs, on the HTML page, and update their text as well. Check out the following example:\nHTML\n\n    \n        This is a paragraph\n    \n\n\nJavaScript\nvar myTextVariable = document.querySelector(\"#myText\");\n\nHere, our document.querySelector code allows us to grab that whole HTML paragraph element, and store it in the myTextVariable variable. Once we have our  element stored in the variable, we can use .textContent to get and set its text like so:\nGetting the  Text\nvar myTextVariable = document.querySelector(\"#myText\");\nvar myTextValue = myTextVariable.textContent;\n\n// show a message with the contents of the #myText paragraph\nalert(myTextValue);\n\nSetting the  Text\nvar myTextVariable = document.querySelector(\"#myText\");\n\n// update the contents of the #myText paragraph\nmyTextVariable.textContent = \"Different\";\n\nCreating an HTML Element with JavaScript\nIn addition to interacting with elements that already exist on the webpage, we can create totally new HTML elements and insert them wherever we want! To create an element, we use document.createElement in JavaScript. This spins up a whole new element, and we can store that element in a variable, like so:\nvar myParagraph = document.createElement(\"p\");\n\nNotice the text between the quotes in the JS: p. This means that we are creating a  element. If we wanted to create a different type of element, we could pass in the name of a different tag, like a or h1. With a p element, we can also set its text content using .textContent:\nvar myParagraph = document.createElement(\"p\");\nmyParagraph.textContent = \"This is a new paragraph!\";\n\nNow that we have a new HTML element created, we have to insert it into our HTML page. To do this, we use .appendChild on an existing HTML element on the page. Here's an example:\nHTML\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nJavaScript\n// store the  element in a variable\nvar containerDiv = document.querySelector(\"#container\");\n\n// create a new  element\nvar myParagraph = document.createElement(\"p\");\n\n// give text to the new  element\nmyParagraph.textContent = \"Paragraph Text\";\n\n// insert the new  element into the \ncontainerDiv.appendChild(myParagraph);\n\nWhen the JavaScript code above is executed, the  element will have a new child  element saying \"Paragraph Text\". It will look like this:\n\n    \n        \n            Paragraph Text\n        \n    \n\n\nNow we know how to read from HTML elements and create new ones!\n"},"Week07/LyricsBuilderFollowAlongInstructions.html":{"url":"Week07/LyricsBuilderFollowAlongInstructions.html","title":"Lyrics Builder Follow-Along","keywords":"","body":"Lyrics Builder\nWe want to create a webpage that will allow us to enter lyrics into a text box line-by-line, and then display them in a nice container.

We will name our function addLine:\nJavaScript File\nfunction addLine() {\n\n}\n\nHTML File\n\n    \n        \n        \n            #lyricsContainer {\n                border: 1px dotted black;\n                height: 500px;\n                width: 500px;\n                padding: 10px;\n            }\n        \n    \n    \n        Lyrics\n        \n        Add Line\n        \n            \n            Add\n        \n    \n\n\nNow when the user clicks the \"Add\" button on our HTML page, the code within the addLine function will run!\nGetting Text from the \nWhenever the user clicks \"Add\", we want to look at the text within the lineText input. First, we need to use document.querySelector to find the  element and store it in a variable:\nfunction addLine() {\n    var lineTextInput = document.querySelector(\"#lineText\");\n}\n\nNotice the selector we are using here: \"#lineText\". After we have the  element stored in a variable, we want to use .value to retrieve the text that has been entered into the field:\nfunction addLine() {\n    var lineTextInput = document.querySelector(\"#lineText\");\n    var lineText = lineTextInput.value;\n}\n\nNow, the text the user entered will be stored in the lineText variable!\nCreating the New  Element\nNow that we have the text, we can create a new paragraph and place the text in it. To create a new element and store it in a variable, we will use document.createElement:\nfunction addLine() {\n    var lineTextInput = document.querySelector(\"#lineText\");\n    var lineText = lineTextInput.value;\n\n    var nextLine = document.createElement(\"p\");\n}\n\nNext, we want to set the text of this new paragraph (stored in the nextLine variable) to the value of our lineText variable, using .textContent:\nfunction addLine() {\n    var lineTextInput = document.querySelector(\"#lineText\");\n    var lineText = lineTextInput.value;\n\n    var nextLine = document.createElement(\"p\");\n    nextLine.textContent = lineText;\n}\n\nNow we have a brand new paragraph!\nInserting the New  Element into the \nWe have created a new paragraph, but it still won't appear on our webpage until we insert it somewhere.

Our task is to add buttons so that we can roll other types of dice as well.\nBackground Information - Random Number Generation\nRandom numbers can be an extremely useful tool when creating games. Any time there is any sort of probability in a game, it's probably using random numbers!\nMath.random\nIn Javascript, you can use Math.random() to generate a random decimal number between 0 and 1.\nExpanding the Range\nTo make the Math.random() number a little more usable, we first multiply it by however many options we'd like. For example, Math.random()*5 would give you a random decimal number between 0 and 5, Math.random()*100 would give you a random decimal number between 0 and 100, and so on. A regular die has 6 sides, so we want to multiply the number by 6.\nLimiting the Numbers to Integers with Math.floor\nIn our case, we want to generate integers. A die has a certain number of integer sides, so decimals do not really make sense. To round down a decimal number, we use Math.floor(), which will round any decimal number DOWN to the nearest whole number. For example, given 0.01, it would return 0. Given 11.9, it would return 11. Given 5.0, it would return 5, because 5 is already a whole number. After rounding down, it is necessary to add 1.\nWhen applied to our randomly-generated number from a given range, we can get all the sides for a die! Now, let's make some updates to our code to make good use of these random numbers.\nA 4-sided Die Roll\nStart by creating another button, labeled \"D4\", next to the \"D6\" button. As with any button that should execute JavaScript, we want to set its onclick attribute. We are also going to define a new function in the DiceRoller.js file. Use the rollD6 function as a template, because the rollD4 function will be very similar.\nHTML\nD4\n\nJS\nfunction rollD4() {\n    var randomDecimal = Math.random();\n    var randomDecimalRange = randomDecimal * 4;\n    var randomDiceRoll = Math.floor(randomDecimalRange)+1;\n    alert(\"You rolled a \" + randomDiceRoll + \"!\");\n}\n\nA D8 Roll\nLet's add another button/function for an 8-sided die. This time, we can simply copy and paste the code for D4. We only have to change a few  things: the function name, the factor multiplied by randomDecimal, and of course, the button text.\nHTML\nD8\n\nJS\nfunction rollD8() {\n    var randomDecimal = Math.random();\n    var randomDecimalRange = randomDecimal * 8;\n    var randomDiceRoll = Math.floor(randomDecimalRange)+1;\n    alert(\"You rolled a \" + randomDiceRoll + \"!\");\n}\n\nYou may notice that this is becoming a little tedious. If we needed to do this for many other types of dice, our code would start to become pretty difficult to manage. Luckily, there is a better way: function parameters!\nFunction Parameters\nSince there is only one small part of the functions that differ for different dice rolls, we can use a single function and a parameter instead! This allows us to cut down on repeated code, and makes it easier for us to change the mechanics for all dice rolls.\nUpdating the Function Definition\nTo add a parameter, we need to place a new variable name within the parenthesis of the function definition, like this:\nfunction rollD8(sides)\n\nAfter that, we can use the sides variable inside of the body of our function. The value of the sides variable will be whatever is passed when the function is called. Replace the 8 in the function body with sides. We should also change the name of this function to reflect that it can handle any number of sides. Change it to simply rollD:\nfunction rollD(sides) {\n    var randomDecimal = Math.random();\n    var randomDecimalRange = randomDecimal * sides;\n    var randomDiceRoll = Math.floor(randomDecimalRange)+1;\n    alert(\"You rolled a \" + randomDiceRoll + \"!\");\n}\n\nUpdating the Function Call\nNow that we've updated our function definition, we need to fix how it is called. In the HTML file, update the onclick attribute for the D8 button so that it calls the correct function, and passes in the correct parameter:\nD8\n\nUpdating the function calls for the other dice\nThe big benefit of these parameters is that we can update our other function calls too! Update the onclick for both the D6 and D4 buttons to call the new rollD function. After doing that, we can even remove the additional functions from our JavaScript file, so we only have rollD.\nD6\nD4\nD8\n\nAdding D20\nIt is now incredibly easy to add a new die. We can simply create a new button, and call the rollD function with the appropriate parameter. Add a D20 button to the page too:\nD20\n\nNotice that we don't have to update anything in our JavaScript file; the parameter makes our code flexible enough to work with new values.\nUsing DOM Manipulation to Display the Dice Roll\nWe want to update our function so that instead of using alert to show the roll result to the user, it updates the text of a paragraph on the HTML page. If we had multiple functions for each die, we would have to update all of those functions individually. Lucky for us, we only need to update one function!\nFollow these steps to update the webpage:\n\nIn the HTML, create a new p element under the buttons\nGive the p a unique id attribute\n\n\nIn the JavaScript, remove the alert from the rollD function\nUse document.querySelector to store the p element in a JavaScript variable\nSet the text of the p element to the message using .textContent\n\nHTML\n\n\nJavaScript\nvar paragraphElement = document.querySelector(\"#myParagraph\");\nparagraphElement.textContent = \"You rolled a \" + randomDiceRoll + \"!\";\n\nNow, when the user clicks any of the dice roll buttons, the code should update the p text on the page!\nAdding D120\nAgain, it is incredibly easy to add an additional button. All we have to do is add a new button in the HTML that calls the rollD function with 120 as the parameter value! You can do this with a die having any number of sides.\nFinal Result\nHTML\n\n    \n        \n            body {\n                background-color: red;\n                text-align: center;\n            }\n\n            h1 {\n                color: black;\n            }\n        \n        \n    \n    \n    \n    Dice\n        D6\n        D4\n        D8\n        D20\n        D120\n        \n    \n\n\nJavaScript\nfunction rollD(sides) {\n    var randomDecimal = Math.random();\n    var randomDecimalRange = randomDecimal * sides;\n    var randomDiceRoll = Math.floor(randomDecimalRange)+1;\n\n    var paragraphElement = document.querySelector(\"#myParagraph\");\n    paragraphElement.textContent = \"You rolled a \" + randomDiceRoll + \"!\";\n}\n\n"},"Week08/IndividualInstructions.html":{"url":"Week08/IndividualInstructions.html","title":"Individual Instructions","keywords":"","body":"Individual Exercise - Background Images\nFollow the instructions below to create a webpage that allows the user to change the background image dynamically. By the end, the user should be able to click buttons to change the background, and enter their own backgrounds image URLs too! Use previous HTML and JavaScript files as references.\nJavaScript code to update the background image\nLater on in this exercise, you will need to update the background image of the page using JavaScript. Here is how you can do that (Replace  with the URL of the image):\ndocument.body.style.background = \"url()\";\n\nRefer back to this code when you need it.\nSetup\nStart from this empty Repl, then follow the steps below.\n\nOpen the index.html file\nIn the index.html file, add the basic tags: html, head, style, body\nCreate a new JavaScript file\nIn the index.html file, use a  tag to link the JavaScript file\n\nOnce you complete this setup, complete each of the exercises below in the HTML file and JavaScript file.\nBackground Image\nIn the style tag, use the following CSS to give the page a background image:\nbody {\n    background: url(https://i.imgur.com/cOxUQHY.jpg);\n}\n\nThis is the ruleset we will update with JavaScript when our buttons are clicked.\nOne Button\n\nIn the JavaScript file, define a function named changeBackground\nRemember, to define a function, you need: function, the name of the function, parentheses, and curly brackets\n\n\nIn the body of the changeBackground function (between { and }), insert the code to update the background image to this one: https://i.imgur.com/MdvJ4C2.jpg\nIn the HTML file, add a button to the body of the page with the text \"Image 1\"\nAdd in code so that when the \"Image 1\" button is clicked, the changeBackground function is called, and the background changes\n\nTwo Buttons\nRepeat the steps above to create ANOTHER button AND function that will change the background to this image: https://i.imgur.com/yfQ8Uj4.jpg\nThe function name and button text should be different. Name the function changeBackground2 and give the button the text \"Image 2\".\nParameter Time\nNow, your JavaScript file should contain two very similar functions. The only differences are the names of the functions, and the actual URLs for the images. Looks like a parameter could help us simplify our code!\nUpdating the Function Definition\n\nIn the changeBackground function, replace the actual URL in the string with a new variable named backgroundUrl\nTo do this, you will have to add together three values: \"url(\" + backgroundUrl + \")\"\n\n\nInstead of declaring backgroundUrl as a variable, make it a parameter by placing it within the parentheses of the function definition\n\nUpdating the Function Calls\n\nIn the HTML file, update the call to changeBackground so that it passes in the original URL as the parameter\nBecause this call is within double quotes, surround the url with single quotes inside of the parentheses, ex: onclick=\"changeBackground('https://i.imgur.com/MdvJ4C2.jpg')\"\n\n\nUpdate the \"Image 2\" button to call the changeBackground function on click as well, passing in its own URL\n\nNow we can get rid of our changeBackground2 function, and everything should still work!\nThree Buttons\nIn the HTML, add a third button. This button should again call the changeBackground function, but it should pass in a new URL: https://i.imgur.com/r9ywXwx.jpg. The button text should be \"Image 3\". Notice that we can add this button without making any changes to the JavaScript!\n(BONUS) Prompt for Image\nAdd another button to the page that, when clicked, will ask the user for a URL, and set the background image to whatever they enter.\n\nIn the JavaScript file, define a new function called promptForBg\nIn the body of the promptForBg function, use a prompt to ask the user what they want the background to be\nMake sure to store their response in a variable\n\n\nUnder that prompt, call the changeBackground function and pass in the value the user entered\nIn the HTML file, create a new button with the text \"Prompt for Bg\" that should call the promptForBg function when clicked\nNote that we do not have to pass in a URL to the promptForBg function - the function will get the URL from the user\n\n\n\nThis is a good example of reusing code to implement new features. By calling the changeBackground function, we were able to avoid unnecessary code duplication!\n(BONUS) Input for Image\nFinally, we want to create an HTML input and a button that will set the background image to whatever URL the user has entered in the input when clicked.\n\nIn the HTML file, create a new div element\nInside the new div element, create a new text input and a new button\nThe input should have an id of \"bgInput\"\nThe button should say \"Input for Bg\"\n\n\nIn the JavaScript file, define a new function called inputForBg\nIn the body of the inputForBg function, select the input element from the HTML, and store it in a variable named bgInputElement\nDeclare another variable named bgInputValue, and set its value to the value of the bgInputElement\nCall the changeBackground function and pass in the bgInputValue variable\nSet the value of the bgInputElement to be empty\nIn the HTML file, make \"Input for Bg\" button call the inputForBg function when clicked\n\nThat's it! Now you should be able to easily set the background of your webpage to any image you like.\n"},"Week08/Challenge.html":{"url":"Week08/Challenge.html","title":"Challenge","keywords":"","body":"Challenge - Various Functions\nCreate a webpage where users can perform various functions on two inputs.\nSetup\nStart from this empty Repl, then follow the steps below.\nBasics\n\nCreate a new JS file\nUpdate the index.html file with all the basic boiler-plate\nAlso in the index.html file:\nCreate two text inputs, each with an id\nCreate a paragraph with an id\nCreate a button with the text \"Add\"\n\n\n\nFirst Button\n\nIn the JavaScript file, define a function named addNumbers\nThe addNumbers function should:\nRetrieve the text values from the two text inputs in the HTML\nConvert the text values into numbers\nAdd the two numbers together\nRetrieve the paragraph from the HTML\nSet the paragraph's text to be the result of the calculation\nClear the text input values\n\n\nIn the HTML file, set the onclick attribute of the button to call the addNumbers function\n\nSecond Button\nRepeat the steps above for a new function: multiplyNumbers. Add a new button to the HTML, and test out both of your buttons.\nAbstracting the Functionality\nSo far, we are able to execute two functions on the two input values. We want to expand this to make it easier to add more functions, without repeating a lot of code.\nSimplifying Functions\nOur addNumbers and multiplyNumbers functions are doing too much right now. In general, functions should do as little as possible, so we don't have to repeat code.\nSimplify the addNumbers and multiplyNumbers functions. They should:\n\nTake in the text values as parameters\nConvert the values to numbers\nPerform the calculation\nReturn the result of the calculation (see below)\n\n// assuming the result of the calculation is stored in calcResult\nreturn calcResult;\n\nRunner Function\nThe next step is to create a runner function that will call all other functions as needed. Each button should be identifiable by a number. The runner function will call the corresponding function.\n\nIn the JavaScript file, define a function named runButton\nThe runButton function should:\nTake in a numeric parameter representing which function to call\nRetrieve the text values from the two text inputs in the HTML\nCall the appropriate function, passing the text values as parameters\nE.g., if the numeric parameter is 1, add. If the numeric parameter is 2, multiply.\n\n\nSet the paragraph's text to the result of the function call\nClear the text input values\n\n\n\nFor example, let's say the \"Add\" button is 1, and the \"Multiply\" button is 2. Calling runButton(1) should perform the addNumbers action, and calling runButton(2) should perform the multiplyNumbers. Note that these identifiers are completely arbitrary. You could use any sort of parameter, as long as the runButton calls the right function!\nUpdating Function Calls\nNow, our runButton function should be able to handle any of our buttons! Update the onclick attribute for each button so that it calls runButton with the appropriate numeric identifier.\nAdding New Buttons\nNow, to add a new button and function, take these steps:\n\nIn the JavaScript, define a new function that will take in two values, and return the result\nCall this function within the runButton function based on its numeric identifier (e.g., 3)\nIn the HTML, create a new button that will call runButton with the numeric identifier as the parameter (e.g., 3)\n\nThat's all! Next, add buttons that will perform the following actions:\n\nDivide the two inputs\nSay whether or not the two inputs are equal (return a string)\nReturn the larger input\nReturn the average of the two inputs\nReturn the larger input minus the smaller input\n\nMore Functions - Single Input\nTry to think of possible calculations to perform on a single input.

We can even manipulate CSS through the DOM! By updating the styles of a webpage dynamically, developers can provide fun and engaging visuals for users. Let's walk through an example.\nExample Description\nWe want to create a simple webpage that allows a user to enter a password. If they enter the correct password, the webpage should inform them that they entered the correct password with a nice green message, and display an image. If they enter an incorrect password, the webpage should inform them that they entered the wrong password with a red message, and hide the image.\nHTML\nBasic Setup\nStart from this empty Repl, open the index.html file, and add the basic tags (html, body, head, style). Additionally, add the header and a paragraph:\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        Password Checker\n        Please enter the correct password to see an image.\n    \n\n\nText Input and Button\nNext, we need a text input and a button. We want them to appear together, on their own line. We can place them inside a div to achieve this structure (right under the paragraph). Note that the input also requires an id so that we can select it in the JavaScript.\n\n    \n    Submit\n\n\npasswordMessage Paragraph and Image\nNext, let's add a paragraph that will contain messages for the user. We need this paragraph to have an id so that we can select it and update it in the JavaScript. This should go under the div.\n\n\nWe also want to add an image underneath this paragraph. We need the image to have an id so that we can select it and update it in the JavaScript. We also need to set its source.\n\n\nWhen a user first loads up the webpage, the image should actually be hidden. We can make this happen with CSS. We will select the image using its id, and then set its display property to none. The CSS should go in the style tag of the HTML page.\n#hiddenImage {\n    display: none;\n}\n\nNow, if a user opens the webpage, the image should be invisible.\nJavaScript Setup\nCreate a new JavaScript file, and link it in the HTML file:\n\n\nInside the JavaScript file, define a new function called submitPassword. For testing purposes, place an alert in the body of the function, saying that the function was called:\nfunction submitPassword() {\n    alert(\"submitPassword called\");\n}\n\nBack in the HTML file, hook up the \"Submit\" button to the function:\nSubmit\n\nNow, a user should be able to load up the page, click the button, and see a message!\nChecking the Password\nOur JavaScript function should check the value the user entered into the text input, and update the page accordingly.\nSelecting HTML Elements\nThe first thing we need to do is select the text input from the HTML, so that we can get its value. Use document.querySelector, along with the id of the input, to accomplish this. Remember, we also need to store this text input in a JavaScript variable. This line should replace the alert at the top of the submitPassword function body:\nvar passwordInput = document.querySelector(\"#passwordInput\");\n\nIn addition to selecting the password input, we are also going to need to select the paragraph for message text, and the image. We can do this in a very similar way:\nvar passwordMessage = document.querySelector(\"#passwordMessage\");\nvar hiddenImage = document.querySelector(\"#hiddenImage\");\n\nPlace these lines directly below the passwordInput variable declaration/setting.\nGetting User Input\nWe have the text input stored in a JavaScript variable (passwordInput), but we need to get its actual value (what the user entered). We do this by using .value, and we have to store the result in another variable:\nvar passwordValue = passwordInput.value;\n\nNow that we have the text the user entered, we can compare it to the correct password. In our case, let's say the correct password is \"opensesame\". We can use an if/else structure to change program flow based on whether their password is correct or incorrect. For now, let's simply alert whether the password was correct or not:\nif (passwordValue === \"opensesame\") {\n    alert(\"You entered the correct password\");\n} else {\n    alert(\"You entered the wrong password\");\n}\n\nNow, a user should be able to load up the webpage, enter a password, click the button, and see a message saying if the password is correct! Test out your code by entering the correct password, and an incorrect password, and making sure the webpage displays the right message.\nSetting Paragraph Text\nInstead of using those alerts, we can give the user a much nicer experience by simply updating an existing HTML element on the page. We've already selected the message paragraph and stored it in a variable: passwordMessage. All we have to do is set its textContent from within the body of the if and else:\nif (passwordValue === \"opensesame\") {\n    passwordMessage.textContent = \"You entered the correct password\";\n} else {\n    passwordMessage.textContent = \"You entered the wrong password\";\n}\n\nNow, instead of displaying a message, the webpage should update with the message underneath the text input. Test out your code again by entering some different passwords.\nUpdating Styles\nTo update the styles of a selected HTML element in JavaScript, a developer can use .style. This will work for any variable holding an HTML element that has styles attached to it. This is similar to how we would use .textContent to update the text inside the element. After .style, you will have to specify which style to access.\nSetting Text Color\nIn addition to setting the textContent of the passwordMessage paragraph, we want to change its color to reflect the tone of the message. If the user enters the correct password, the color should be green. If they enter the wrong password, the color should be red. To set the text color of the element, use .style.color:\nif (passwordValue === \"opensesame\") {\n    passwordMessage.textContent = \"You entered the correct password\";\n    passwordMessage.style.color = \"green\";\n} else {\n    passwordMessage.textContent = \"You entered the wrong password\";\n    passwordMessage.style.color = \"red\";\n}\n\nTest out your code again. It should work the same, except when you enter the correct password, the message should be green. When you enter the wrong password, the message should be red.\nShowing the Image\nTo start off, we have CSS on our image setting its display property to the value none. This will hide the image. To show it, we need to set its display property to block. We can do this in a very similar way to setting the text color; we will use .style.display. We already have the HTML element for the image stored in a variable (hiddenImage). We just need to set its CSS.\nif (passwordValue === \"opensesame\") {\n    passwordMessage.textContent = \"You entered the correct password\";\n    passwordMessage.style.color = \"green\";\n    hiddenImage.style.display = \"block\";\n} else {\n    passwordMessage.textContent = \"You entered the wrong password\";\n    passwordMessage.style.color = \"red\";\n    hiddenImage.style.display = \"none\";\n}\n\nTest out your code again. Now, the image should show up when you enter the correct password, and hide otherwise!\nFinal Product\nHTML\n\n    \n        \n        \n            #hiddenImage {\n                display: none;\n            }\n        \n    \n    \n        Password Checker\n        Please enter the correct password to see an image.\n        \n            \n            Submit\n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nJavaScript\nfunction submitPassword() {\n    var passwordInput = document.querySelector(\"#passwordInput\");\n    var passwordMessage = document.querySelector(\"#passwordMessage\");\n    var hiddenImage = document.querySelector(\"#hiddenImage\");\n\n    var passwordValue = passwordInput.value;\n\n    if (passwordValue === \"opensesame\") {\n        passwordMessage.textContent = \"You entered the correct password\";\n        passwordMessage.style.color = \"green\";\n        hiddenImage.style.display = \"block\";\n    } else {\n        passwordMessage.textContent = \"You entered the wrong password\";\n        passwordMessage.style.color = \"red\";\n        hiddenImage.style.display = \"none\";\n    }\n}\n\n"},"Week11/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"Week11/StudentDesc.html","title":"Final Project","keywords":"","body":"Web 102: Final Project\nComplete a final project.
