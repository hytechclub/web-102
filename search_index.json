Repl, then follow the instructions below to build a simple webpage!\nTo fork the Repl, click the \"Fork Repl\" button on the page:\n\nAdd the Basic HTML Elements\nAdd the foundational elements to the index.html file. Start with , then add  and  between the HTML tags.\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\nAdd a Header\nBetween the opening and closing body tags, add an h3 element. Within the h3 element, add the proper text.\nDespicable Me Fan Site\n\nAdd an Image\nAdd an image to the page.\n\nGo to Google Images\nFind an image, and copy the image address/URL/location\nCreate an img tag, and set its src attribute to be the URL for the image\n\n\n\nAdd a Paragraph\nUnder the img element, add a p element that contains the text for the paragraph.\nDespicable Me is a great film filled with several memorable characters and zany plot lines.\n\nAdd Another Header\nUnder the p, add another h3 header that will serve as the title for a list.\nTop Three Movies Of All Time\n\nAdd a List\nUnder the h3, create an ol element. Between the opening and closing tags, create three li elements with the proper text.\n\n    Despicable Me\n    Despicable Me 2\n    Despicable Me 3\n\n\nCreate a New CSS File\nNow it's time to add some style. Create a new file named style.css, and save it in the same folder as the index.html file. In the file, add a ruleset that will select the body (all the content on the page). Within the ruleset, set the background property to black, and the color property to orange.\nbody {\n    background: black;\n    color: orange;\n}\n\nLink the CSS in the HTML\nAlthough CSS has been added to the style.css file, nothing has changed on the page! This is because the CSS file must be linked in the HTML file.\nIn the index.html file, between the opening and closing head tags, create a link tag. It should have an href attribute with the value style.css, a type attribute with the value text/css, and a rel attribute with the value stylesheet. Now the page should have the styles!\n\n\nAdd an Image Style\nCurrently, the image might be a little big. Use CSS to update its size. In the style.css file, add a ruleset that will select the img. Within the ruleset, set the height property to 200px.\nimg {\n    height: 200px;\n}\n\nAdd a Main Header Style\nNext, it would be nice for the main header to stand out a little more. To select this header specifically, but not any other header, add an id attribute to it in the HTML, and then select it by its ID in the CSS.\nIn the index.html file, find the top h3 header. Add an id attribute with a value of main to the element.\nDespicable Me Fan Site\n\nIn the style.css file, add a ruleset that will select elements with an ID of main using #main. Within the ruleset, set the color property to yellow (this is the color of the minions).\n#main {\n    color: yellow;\n}\n\nFinal Code\nThat's it! The Despicable Me Fan Site looks pretty good.\nindex.html\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n        Despicable Me Fan Site\n        \n        Despicable Me is a great film filled with several memorable characters and zany plot lines.\n\n        Top Three Movies Of All Time\n        \n            Despicable Me\n            Despicable Me 2\n            Despicable Me 3\n        \n\n    \n\n\nstyle.css\nbody {\n    background: black;\n    color: orange;\n}\n\nimg {\n    height: 200px;\n}\n\n#main {\n    color: yellow;\n}\n\n"},"Week01/IntroduceYourself.html":{"url":"Week01/IntroduceYourself.html","title":"Introduce Yourself","keywords":"","body":"Introduce yourself!\nMake a webpage displaying some basic information about you.

You can find a list of common formulas here: http://www.mdc.edu/main/images/common_math_formulas_tcm6-33520.pdf. Choose some cool ones, and create calculators for them. If you're feeling ambitious, you can make up some of your own formulas too! Create at least five formula calculators.\nSome good formulas to try:\n\nVolume of a Sphere\nVolume of a Cone\nDistance between two points\nQuadratic formula\n\nEach page should ask the user for input, perform a calculation, and show the answer. For some of the more involved formulas, you may need to use some of the JavaScript math utilities: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_math.asp\nFinally, create one main HTML page that links to each of your calculators.\n"},"Week03/AdditionalChallenges.html":{"url":"Week03/AdditionalChallenges.html","title":"Additional Challenges","keywords":"","body":"Additional Challenges\nAccomplish all of the challenges below without using if, switch, or any loops.

Ask the user to enter a message, and then ask them how many times they would like to repeat it. Display the output.\nDice Roll\nCreate a new HTML page that, when opened, will display a message with a random number from 1-6.\nMany-sided Die\nBefore displaying the random number, ask the user how many choices should be available for the dice roll. There should be no limit to the number of sides on the die. For example, if the user says \"12\", the program should display a random number from 1-12.\nVisual Die\nCreate another new HTML page where, instead of simply displaying the number, it displays a visual representation of the die. For example, a roll of 2 would display \"X X \", a roll of 5 would display \"X X X X X \", and so on.\nRandom Password\nCreate a new HTML page that will generate a numeric random password for the user. First, ask the user how many characters they would like for the password (1-16). Then, generate the password for them! The password should consist of only numeric characters.\nNon-numeric Password\nCreate another HTML page that will generate a random password consisting of alphanumeric characters. Ask the user how many characters they would like for the password (1-8). Then, generate the password for them! The password should consist of only lowercase letters.\nDivision with Quotient and Remainder\nCreate another HTML page that will calculate the quotient AND remainder for two numbers. Ask the user to enter the two numbers (the dividend and divisor) and then display the quotient and remainder. For example, if the user enters \"15\" for the dividend, and \"7\" for the divisor, the program should output \"7 R 1\". You can use this tool to test your math: https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/longdivision.php\nMultiply by 2\nCreate another HTML page that will multiply a given number by 2, with one catch: do not use +, -, /, or *. Ask the user for a number to multiply, and then perform the calculation. For example, if the user enters \"6\", the program should display \"12\".\nMultiply by a Power of 2\nInstead of multiplying by 2 every time, ask the user for a power of 2 to multiply by. For example, if the user enters \"5\" for the number, and \"2\" for the power of 2, the program should perform the calculation 5 times (2^2), which reduces to 5 times 4, and display \"20\". In this example, the ^ symbol represents an exponent. If the user enters \"9\" for the number and \"9\" for the power of 2, the program should perform the calculation 9 times (2^9) and display \"4608\".\nRegular Expressions\nLearn about regular expressions with this tutorial: https://regexone.com/\nThen, create another HTML page that will test a string against a regular expression. For example, if the user entered \"Hello\" for the string, and \"ello\" for the regular expression, the program should display \"true\". If the user entered \"Hello\" for the string, and \"ello2\" for the regular expression, the program should display \"false\".\n"},"Week04/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"Week04/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 4 - Buttons","keywords":"","body":".js Files & Buttons\nLearn how to define functions in separate files that make buttons do things on a webpage.

It contains some basic HTML and CSS, but no JavaScript yet!\nAdd a new JavaScript file to the Repl project, and link it from the html file.\n\nIn the Files area of the Repl, click the \"Add file\" button\nName the new file script.js\nOpen the index.html file for editing\nBetween the  and , under the , make a new line\nThere, add a  element\nSet the src attribute of the script to script.js\n\nThe added HTML should look something like this:\n\n\nFunction & Button\nNext, it's time to define a JavaScript function, and hook it up to a button in HTML.\nDefining the Function\nStart by defining the function.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nAdd code to define a function named chat\nKeyword: function\nFunction name: chat\nParentheses: ()\nCurly brackets: {}\n\n\nIn the body of the function (between { and }), make a new line\nAdd an alert statement that says \"Welcome to the Friend Proxy Chatbot!\"\n\nThe code in the script.js file should look something like this:\nfunction chat() {\n    alert(\"Welcome to the Friend Proxy Chatbot!\");\n}\n\nNow the function is defined, but there is no way to run it yet!\nCreating the Button\nCreate a button and hook it up to the function.\n\nOpen the index.html file for editing\nBetween the  and , under the , make a new line\nThere, add a  element\nSet the onclick attribute of the button to call the chat function\nchat()\n\n\nMake the text of the button say \"Chat\"\n\nThe added HTML should look something like this:\nChat\n\nRun the code. Click the \"Chat\" button on the page, and verify that a message appears!\nPrompt for Message\nNow, all new changes for the site will happen in the script.js file, within the chat function body. Start by prompting for the user to enter a message.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nMake a new line between the { and }, under the alert statement\nCreate a new variable named message\nSet the message variable to a prompt\nMake the text for the prompt say \"Please enter a message...\"\n\nThe added JavaScript should look something like this:\nvar message = prompt(\"Please enter a message...\");\n\nRun the code. Click the button, and verify that a prompt appears asking for a message. Nothing will happen when entering a message yet though!\nResponding to the Message\nNext, the chatbot should respond to certain messages the user enters. This is where if statements come in: the response should be different depending on the message.\nTo start, have the chatbot respond to a message of \"Hello\" from the user.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nMake a new line between the { and }, under the message variable\nThere, create an if statement\nKeyword: if\nParentheses: ()\nCurly brackets: {}\n\n\nFor the if condition, check if the user said \"Hello\"\nCondition goes between the parentheses\nUse message variable, ===, and \"Hello\" to compare\n\n\nIn the body of the if, display a message saying \"Well hi there!\"\nBody is between the curly brackets\nUse alert(\"Well hi there!\");\n\n\n\nThe added JavaScript should look something like this:\nif (message === \"Hello\") {\n    alert(\"Well hi there!\");\n}\n\nRun the code. Click the button, enter \"Hello\" as the message, and verify that the proper response appears! If any other message is entered, no response should appear.\nMore Responses\nThe chatbot is functional, but it is not very powerful yet. It needs to be able to respond to some more messages! Add a couple more responses using if statements.\n\n\n\nMessage\nResponse\n\n\n\n\nI love you\nThat's nice\n\n\nAre you my friend?\nYes, of course...\n\n\n\nThese if statements will look very similar to the previous if statement. For each of the responses, follow these steps:\n\nHave the script.js file open for editing\nMake a new line at the bottom of the chat body (above })\nAdd an if statement: if () {}\nFor the condition (between ( and )), check if message === the given message\nIn the body (between { and }), alert with the response\n\nThe added JavaScript should look something like this:\nif (message === \"I love you\") {\n    alert(\"That's nice\");\n}\n\nif (message === \"Are you my friend?\") {\n    alert(\"Yes, of course...\");\n}\n\nRun the code. Click the button, and try out each of the messages. Make sure to enter them exactly right, with proper punctuation/capitalization/etc. Each message should produce the correct response!\nFinal Code\nBy the end of the activity, the code should look something like this:\nindex.html\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        Friend Proxy Chatbot ๐ฃ๏ธ๐ค\n        Press the \"Chat\" button to talk to the friend proxy chatbot.\n\n        Chat\n    \n\n\nscript.js\nfunction chat() {\n    alert(\"Welcome to the Friend Proxy Chatbot!\");\n\n    var message = prompt(\"Please enter a message...\");\n\n    if (message === \"Hello\") {\n        alert(\"Well hi there!\");\n    }\n\n    if (message === \"I love you\") {\n        alert(\"That's nice\");\n    }\n\n    if (message === \"Are you my friend?\") {\n        alert(\"Yes, of course...\");\n    }\n}\n\n"},"Week05/ChatbotIndividual.html":{"url":"Week05/ChatbotIndividual.html","title":"Chatbot Individual Exercise","keywords":"","body":"Chatbot Individual Work\nUpdate the chatbot to make it more robust.\nMore Responses\nThere is always room for more responses to be added to the chatbot!

There should be a catch-all response for any messages that are not properly handled. This is possible using an else if and else structure.\nRead through this page for more information about how else if works.

While this works, the user experience is less than ideal. A better way to communicate with users is through the HTML itself, by using DOM Manipulation. Using DOM manipulation is the next step toward creating a truly dynamic web experience.\nAfter reading through this guide, you should be able to use JavaScript to read from existing HTML elements.\nBefore that, though, let's start with some background information.\nBackground\nWhat is the DOM?\nThe Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page. For more information, check out this article from Mozilla: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction\nRepresenting HTML Elements in JavaScript\nSo far, we have stored a few different things in JavaScript variables: Numbers, Strings, and Booleans. These are known as Data Types. To store something bigger, like a whole HTML input element, we need to use another data type: Object. Objects in JavaScript can store pretty much anything! For now, we are going to use them to store HTML elements that exist in our HTML document.\nImplementation\nNow, let's cover how we will actually use these concepts to make our webpages more interactive!\nStoring an HTML Element in a JavaScript Variable\nTo find an element within our HTML page and store it in a variable, we use document.querySelector. This allows us to select an HTML element in the same way we would select it to style it in CSS. Note that here, we are storing the ACTUAL HTML ELEMENT, not just the text!\nHTML\n\n    \n        Input your message: \n    \n\n\nJavaScript\nvar myMessageVariable = document.querySelector(\"#myInput\");\n\n\nNotice the text between the quotes in the JS: #myInput. This is exactly what we would use in CSS to select and style the input with an id of \"myInput\".\n\nHere, our document.querySelector code allows us to grab that whole HTML input element, and store it in the myMessageVariable variable. Once we have our HTML element stored in the variable, we can interact with it! We can use .value to get and set the text entered in the  tag like so:\nGetting the  Value\nvar myMessageVariable = document.querySelector(\"#myInput\");\nvar myMessageValue = myMessageVariable.value;\n\n// show a message with the contents of the #myInput input\nalert(\"Your message was: \" + myMessageValue);\n\n"},"Week06/MadLibsFollowAlong.html":{"url":"Week06/MadLibsFollowAlong.html","title":"Mad Libs Follow-Along","keywords":"","body":"Mad Libs Follow-Along\nCreate a webpage that will allow the user to enter some individual words and tell a silly story.\n\nBasic Setup\nStart by forking this empty Repl, then follow the steps below.\n\nOpen the index.html file\nAdd the basic tags: html, head, body\nCreate a new JavaScript file called MadLibs.js\nLink the JavaScript file in the HTML file using a script tag\n\nCreating the Inputs in HTML\n\nIn the HTML file, create an appropriate header for the webpage saying \"Pizza Pizza\"\nCreate a p paragraph element containing a text label and a textbox input for \"Adjective\"\nEnsure that the input element has an id attribute\n\n\nCreate additional p elements containing labels and inputs for \"Nationality\" and \"Person\"\n\nindex.html\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n        Pizza Pizza\n        Adjective: \n        Nationality: \n        Person: \n    \n\n\nDefining the Function in JavaScript\nIn the JavaScript file, define a new function named madLibs:\n\nfunction keyword\nfunction name (madLibs)\nparentheses (())\ncurly brackets ({})\n\nMadLibs.js\nfunction madLibs() {\n\n}\n\nGetting the Values from Inputs\nIn the body of the madLibs function:\n\nStore the\"Adjective\" input element in a variable\nnew variable (var adj1El =)\ndocument.querySelector()\nquotes (\"\")\nselector for the first input (#adj)\n\n\nStore the text from the input element in a variable\nnew variable (var adj1Val =)\nelement variable (adj1El)\n.value\n\n\nRepeat the above steps for each of the three inputs\n\nMadLibs.js\nvar adj1El = document.querySelector(\"#adj1\");\nvar adj1Val = adj1El.value;\n\nvar nationalityEl = document.querySelector(\"#nationality\");\nvar nationalityVal = nationalityEl.value;\n\nvar personEl = document.querySelector(\"#person\");\nvar personVal = personEl.value;\n\nDisplaying the Story\nCreate an alert and put the story together.

After reading through this guide, you should be able to use JavaScript to:\n\nUpdate existing HTML elements\nCreate new HTML elements\nAdd new HTML elements to your webpage\n\nGetting and Setting Paragraph Text\nIt is possible to read from existing paragraphs, on the HTML page, and update their text as well. Check out the following example:\nHTML\n\n    \n        This is a paragraph\n    \n\n\nJavaScript\nvar myTextVariable = document.querySelector(\"#myText\");\n\nHere, our document.querySelector code allows us to grab that whole HTML paragraph element, and store it in the myTextVariable variable. Once we have our  element stored in the variable, we can use .textContent to get and set its text like so:\nGetting the  Text\nvar myTextVariable = document.querySelector(\"#myText\");\nvar myTextValue = myTextVariable.textContent;\n\n// show a message with the contents of the #myText paragraph\nalert(myTextValue);\n\nSetting the  Text\nvar myTextVariable = document.querySelector(\"#myText\");\n\n// update the contents of the #myText paragraph\nmyTextVariable.textContent = \"Different\";\n\nCreating an HTML Element with JavaScript\nIn addition to interacting with elements that already exist on the webpage, we can create totally new HTML elements and insert them wherever we want! To create an element, we use document.createElement in JavaScript. This spins up a whole new element, and we can store that element in a variable, like so:\nvar myParagraph = document.createElement(\"p\");\n\nNotice the text between the quotes in the JS: p. This means that we are creating a  element. If we wanted to create a different type of element, we could pass in the name of a different tag, like a or h1. With a p element, we can also set its text content using .textContent:\nvar myParagraph = document.createElement(\"p\");\nmyParagraph.textContent = \"This is a new paragraph!\";\n\nNow that we have a new HTML element created, we have to insert it into our HTML page. To do this, we use .appendChild on an existing HTML element on the page. Here's an example:\nHTML\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nJavaScript\n// store the  element in a variable\nvar containerDiv = document.querySelector(\"#container\");\n\n// create a new  element\nvar myParagraph = document.createElement(\"p\");\n\n// give text to the new  element\nmyParagraph.textContent = \"Paragraph Text\";\n\n// insert the new  element into the \ncontainerDiv.appendChild(myParagraph);\n\nWhen the JavaScript code above is executed, the  element will have a new child  element saying \"Paragraph Text\".

Then, we can link the file to our HTML page in a  tag:\n\n    \n        \n        \n            #lyricsContainer {\n                border: 1px dotted black;\n                height: 500px;\n                width: 500px;\n                padding: 10px;\n            }\n        \n    \n    \n        Lyrics\n        \n        Add Line\n        \n            \n            Add\n        \n    \n\n\nButton Function\nOnce we have a linked JavaScript file, we can use it to define a function that will execute when the user clicks our \"Add\" button. We will name our function addLine:\nJavaScript File\nfunction addLine() {\n\n}\n\nHTML File\n\n    \n        \n        \n            #lyricsContainer {\n                border: 1px dotted black;\n                height: 500px;\n                width: 500px;\n                padding: 10px;\n            }\n        \n    \n    \n        Lyrics\n        \n        Add Line\n        \n            \n            Add\n        \n    \n\n\nNow when the user clicks the \"Add\" button on our HTML page, the code within the addLine function will run!\nGetting Text from the \nWhenever the user clicks \"Add\", we want to look at the text within the lineText input. First, we need to use document.querySelector to find the  element and store it in a variable:\nfunction addLine() {\n    var lineTextInput = document.querySelector(\"#lineText\");\n}\n\nNotice the selector we are using here: \"#lineText\". After we have the  element stored in a variable, we want to use .value to retrieve the text that has been entered into the field:\nfunction addLine() {\n    var lineTextInput = document.querySelector(\"#lineText\");\n    var lineText = lineTextInput.value;\n}\n\nNow, the text the user entered will be stored in the lineText variable!\nCreating the New  Element\nNow that we have the text, we can create a new paragraph and place the text in it. To create a new element and store it in a variable, we will use document.createElement:\nfunction addLine() {\n    var lineTextInput = document.querySelector(\"#lineText\");\n    var lineText = lineTextInput.value;\n\n    var nextLine = document.createElement(\"p\");\n}\n\nNext, we want to set the text of this new paragraph (stored in the nextLine variable) to the value of our lineText variable, using .textContent:\nfunction addLine() {\n    var lineTextInput = document.querySelector(\"#lineText\");\n    var lineText = lineTextInput.value;\n\n    var nextLine = document.createElement(\"p\");\n    nextLine.textContent = lineText;\n}\n\nNow we have a brand new paragraph!\nInserting the New  Element into the \nWe have created a new paragraph, but it still won't appear on our webpage until we insert it somewhere. We want to place it in the lyrics box, our lyricsContainer div. The first thing we need to do is find that  element and store it in a variable:\nfunction addLine() {\n    var lineTextInput = document.querySelector(\"#lineText\");\n    var lineText = lineTextInput.value;\n\n    var nextLine = document.createElement(\"p\");\n    nextLine.textContent = lineText;\n\n    var lyricsContainer = document.querySelector(\"#lyricsContainer\");\n}\n\nNotice the selector we are using here: \"#lyricsContainer\". Now that we have our  element stored in the lyricsContainer variable, we can insert the paragraph into it! To do that, we use .appendChild:\nfunction addLine() {\n    var lineTextInput = document.querySelector(\"#lineText\");\n    var lineText = lineTextInput.value;\n\n    var nextLine = document.createElement(\"p\");\n    nextLine.textContent = lineText;\n\n    var lyricsContainer = document.querySelector(\"#lyricsContainer\");\n    lyricsContainer.appendChild(nextLine);\n}\n\nNow, when we click our button, it should create a new paragraph and add it to the lyrics container!\nClearing the Input\nThe last thing we need to do is clear out the value of our  after a line has been added. To accomplish this, we simply set .value of the  to the empty string (\"\"):\nfunction addLine() {\n    var lineTextInput = document.querySelector(\"#lineText\");\n    var lineText = lineTextInput.value;\n\n    var nextLine = document.createElement(\"p\");\n    nextLine.textContent = lineText;\n\n    var lyricsContainer = document.querySelector(\"#lyricsContainer\");\n    lyricsContainer.appendChild(nextLine);\n\n    lineTextInput.value = \"\";\n}\n\nNow our Lyrics Builder is fully functional!\nFinal Product\nHTML\n\n    \n        \n        \n            #lyricsContainer {\n                border: 1px dotted black;\n                height: 500px;\n                width: 500px;\n                padding: 10px;\n            }\n        \n    \n    \n        Lyrics\n        \n        Add Line\n        \n            \n            Add\n        \n    \n\n\nJavaScript (LyricsBuilder.js)\nfunction addLine() {\n    var lineTextInput = document.querySelector(\"#lineText\");\n    var lineText = lineTextInput.value;\n    var nextLine = document.createElement(\"p\");\n    nextLine.textContent = lineText;\n\n    var lyricsContainer = document.querySelector(\"#lyricsContainer\");\n    lyricsContainer.appendChild(nextLine);\n\n    lineTextInput.value = \"\";\n}\n\n"},"Week07/BackgroundChangerIndividualInstructions.html":{"url":"Week07/BackgroundChangerIndividualInstructions.html","title":"Background Changer Individual Exercise","keywords":"","body":"Background Changer Revisited\nPreviously, we created a webpage that could change its background color on a button click.

Our task is to add buttons so that we can roll other types of dice as well.\nBackground Information - Random Number Generation\nRandom numbers can be an extremely useful tool when creating games. Any time there is any sort of probability in a game, it's probably using random numbers!\nMath.random\nIn Javascript, you can use Math.random() to generate a random decimal number between 0 and 1.\nExpanding the Range\nTo make the Math.random() number a little more usable, we first multiply it by however many options we'd like. For example, Math.random()*5 would give you a random decimal number between 0 and 5, Math.random()*100 would give you a random decimal number between 0 and 100, and so on. A regular die has 6 sides, so we want to multiply the number by 6.\nLimiting the Numbers to Integers with Math.floor\nIn our case, we want to generate integers. A die has a certain number of integer sides, so decimals do not really make sense. To round down a decimal number, we use Math.floor(), which will round any decimal number DOWN to the nearest whole number. For example, given 0.01, it would return 0. Given 11.9, it would return 11. Given 5.0, it would return 5, because 5 is already a whole number. After rounding down, it is necessary to add 1.\nWhen applied to our randomly-generated number from a given range, we can get all the sides for a die! Now, let's make some updates to our code to make good use of these random numbers.\nA 4-sided Die Roll\nStart by creating another button, labeled \"D4\", next to the \"D6\" button. As with any button that should execute JavaScript, we want to set its onclick attribute. We are also going to define a new function in the DiceRoller.js file. Use the rollD6 function as a template, because the rollD4 function will be very similar.\nHTML\nD4\n\nJS\nfunction rollD4() {\n    var randomDecimal = Math.random();\n    var randomDecimalRange = randomDecimal * 4;\n    var randomDiceRoll = Math.floor(randomDecimalRange)+1;\n    alert(\"You rolled a \" + randomDiceRoll + \"!\");\n}\n\nA D8 Roll\nLet's add another button/function for an 8-sided die. This time, we can simply copy and paste the code for D4. We only have to change a few  things: the function name, the factor multiplied by randomDecimal, and of course, the button text.\nHTML\nD8\n\nJS\nfunction rollD8() {\n    var randomDecimal = Math.random();\n    var randomDecimalRange = randomDecimal * 8;\n    var randomDiceRoll = Math.floor(randomDecimalRange)+1;\n    alert(\"You rolled a \" + randomDiceRoll + \"!\");\n}\n\nYou may notice that this is becoming a little tedious. If we needed to do this for many other types of dice, our code would start to become pretty difficult to manage. Luckily, there is a better way: function parameters!\nFunction Parameters\nSince there is only one small part of the functions that differ for different dice rolls, we can use a single function and a parameter instead! This allows us to cut down on repeated code, and makes it easier for us to change the mechanics for all dice rolls.\nUpdating the Function Definition\nTo add a parameter, we need to place a new variable name within the parenthesis of the function definition, like this:\nfunction rollD8(sides)\n\nAfter that, we can use the sides variable inside of the body of our function. The value of the sides variable will be whatever is passed when the function is called. Replace the 8 in the function body with sides. We should also change the name of this function to reflect that it can handle any number of sides. Change it to simply rollD:\nfunction rollD(sides) {\n    var randomDecimal = Math.random();\n    var randomDecimalRange = randomDecimal * sides;\n    var randomDiceRoll = Math.floor(randomDecimalRange)+1;\n    alert(\"You rolled a \" + randomDiceRoll + \"!\");\n}\n\nUpdating the Function Call\nNow that we've updated our function definition, we need to fix how it is called. In the HTML file, update the onclick attribute for the D8 button so that it calls the correct function, and passes in the correct parameter:\nD8\n\nUpdating the function calls for the other dice\nThe big benefit of these parameters is that we can update our other function calls too! Update the onclick for both the D6 and D4 buttons to call the new rollD function. After doing that, we can even remove the additional functions from our JavaScript file, so we only have rollD.\nD6\nD4\nD8\n\nAdding D20\nIt is now incredibly easy to add a new die. We can simply create a new button, and call the rollD function with the appropriate parameter. Add a D20 button to the page too:\nD20\n\nNotice that we don't have to update anything in our JavaScript file; the parameter makes our code flexible enough to work with new values.\nUsing DOM Manipulation to Display the Dice Roll\nWe want to update our function so that instead of using alert to show the roll result to the user, it updates the text of a paragraph on the HTML page. If we had multiple functions for each die, we would have to update all of those functions individually. Lucky for us, we only need to update one function!\nFollow these steps to update the webpage:\n\nIn the HTML, create a new p element under the buttons\nGive the p a unique id attribute\n\n\nIn the JavaScript, remove the alert from the rollD function\nUse document.querySelector to store the p element in a JavaScript variable\nSet the text of the p element to the message using .textContent\n\nHTML\n\n\nJavaScript\nvar paragraphElement = document.querySelector(\"#myParagraph\");\nparagraphElement.textContent = \"You rolled a \" + randomDiceRoll + \"!\";\n\nNow, when the user clicks any of the dice roll buttons, the code should update the p text on the page!\nAdding D120\nAgain, it is incredibly easy to add an additional button. All we have to do is add a new button in the HTML that calls the rollD function with 120 as the parameter value! You can do this with a die having any number of sides.\nFinal Result\nHTML\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n    \n    Dice\n        D6\n        D4\n        D8\n        D20\n        D120\n        \n    \n\n\nJavaScript\nfunction rollD(sides) {\n    var randomDecimal = Math.random();\n    var randomDecimalRange = randomDecimal * sides;\n  var randomDiceRoll = Math.floor(randomDecimalRange)+1;\n\n  var paragraphElement = document.querySelector(\"#myParagraph\");\n  paragraphElement.textContent = \"You rolled a \" + randomDiceRoll + \"!\";\n}\n\n"},"Week08/IndividualInstructions.html":{"url":"Week08/IndividualInstructions.html","title":"Individual Instructions","keywords":"","body":"Individual Exercise - Background Images\nFollow the instructions below to create a webpage that allows the user to change the background image dynamically. By the end, the user should be able to click buttons to change the background, and enter their own backgrounds image URLs too!

Here is how you can do that (Replace  with the URL of the image):\ndocument.body.style.background = \"url()\";\n\nRefer back to this code when you need it.\nSetup\nStart by forking this starter Repl, then follow the steps below to add an initial background image. In the style tag, use the following CSS:\nbody {\n    background: url(Planet.jpg);\n}\n\nThis is the ruleset we will update with JavaScript when our buttons are clicked.\nOne Button\n\nIn the JavaScript file, define a function named changeBackground\nRemember, to define a function, you need: function, the name of the function, parentheses, and curly brackets\n\n\nIn the body of the changeBackground function (between { and }), insert the code to update the background image to this one: Pokemon.jpg\nIn the HTML file, add a button to the body of the page with the text \"Image 1\"\nAdd in code so that when the \"Image 1\" button is clicked, the changeBackground function is called, and the background changes\n\nTwo Buttons\nRepeat the steps above to create ANOTHER button AND function that will change the background to this image: City.jpg\nThe function name and button text should be different. Name the function changeBackground2 and give the button the text \"Image 2\".\nParameter Time\nNow, your JavaScript file should contain two very similar functions. The only differences are the names of the functions, and the actual URLs for the images. Looks like a parameter could help us simplify our code!\nUpdating the Function Definition\n\nIn the changeBackground function, replace the actual URL in the string with a new variable named backgroundUrl\nTo do this, you will have to add together three values: \"url(\" + backgroundUrl + \")\"\n\n\nInstead of declaring backgroundUrl as a variable, make it a parameter by placing it within the parentheses of the function definition\n\nUpdating the Function Calls\n\nIn the HTML file, update the call to changeBackground so that it passes in the original URL as the parameter\nBecause this call is within double quotes, surround the url with single quotes inside of the parentheses, ex: onclick=\"changeBackground('Pokemon.jpg')\"\n\n\nUpdate the \"Image 2\" button to call the changeBackground function on click as well, passing in its own URL\n\nNow we can get rid of our changeBackground2 function, and everything should still work!\nThree Buttons\nIn the HTML, add a third button. This button should again call the changeBackground function, but it should pass in a new URL: CalvinAndHobbes.jpg. The button text should be \"Image 3\". Notice that we can add this button without making any changes to the JavaScript!\n(BONUS) Prompt for Image\nAdd another button to the page that, when clicked, will ask the user for a URL, and set the background image to whatever they enter.\n\nIn the JavaScript file, define a new function called promptForBg\nIn the body of the promptForBg function, use a prompt to ask the user what they want the background to be\nMake sure to store their response in a variable\n\n\nUnder that prompt, call the changeBackground function and pass in the value the user entered\nIn the HTML file, create a new button with the text \"Prompt for Bg\" that should call the promptForBg function when clicked\nNote that we do not have to pass in a URL to the promptForBg function - the function will get the URL from the user\n\n\n\nThis is a good example of reusing code to implement new features. By calling the changeBackground function, we were able to avoid unnecessary code duplication!\n(BONUS) Input for Image\nFinally, we want to create an HTML input and a button that will set the background image to whatever URL the user has entered in the input when clicked.\n\nIn the HTML file, create a new div element\nInside the new div element, create a new text input and a new button\nThe input should have an id of \"bgInput\"\nThe button should say \"Input for Bg\"\n\n\nIn the JavaScript file, define a new function called inputForBg\nIn the body of the inputForBg function, select the input element from the HTML, and store it in a variable named bgInputElement\nDeclare another variable named bgInputValue, and set its value to the value of the bgInputElement\nCall the changeBackground function and pass in the bgInputValue variable\nSet the value of the bgInputElement to be empty\nIn the HTML file, make \"Input for Bg\" button call the inputForBg function when clicked\n\nThat's it! Now you should be able to easily set the background of your webpage to any image you like.\n"},"Week08/Challenge.html":{"url":"Week08/Challenge.html","title":"Challenge","keywords":"","body":"Challenge - Various Functions\nCreate a webpage where users can perform various functions on two inputs.\nSetup\nStart from this empty Repl, then follow the steps below.\nBasics\n\nCreate a new JS file\nUpdate the index.html file with all the basic boiler-plate\nAlso in the index.html file:\nCreate two text inputs, each with an id\nCreate a paragraph with an id\nCreate a button with the text \"Add\"\n\n\n\nFirst Button\n\nIn the JavaScript file, define a function named addNumbers\nThe addNumbers function should:\nRetrieve the text values from the two text inputs in the HTML\nConvert the text values into numbers\nAdd the two numbers together\nRetrieve the paragraph from the HTML\nSet the paragraph's text to be the result of the calculation\nClear the text input values\n\n\nIn the HTML file, set the onclick attribute of the button to call the addNumbers function\n\nSecond Button\nRepeat the steps above for a new function: multiplyNumbers.

The runner function will call the corresponding function.\n\nIn the JavaScript file, define a function named runButton\nThe runButton function should:\nTake in a numeric parameter representing which function to call\nRetrieve the text values from the two text inputs in the HTML\nCall the appropriate function, passing the text values as parameters\nE.g., if the numeric parameter is 1, add. If the numeric parameter is 2, multiply.\n\n\nSet the paragraph's text to the result of the function call\nClear the text input values\n\n\n\nFor example, let's say the \"Add\" button is 1, and the \"Multiply\" button is 2. Calling runButton(1) should perform the addNumbers action, and calling runButton(2) should perform the multiplyNumbers. Note that these identifiers are completely arbitrary. You could use any sort of parameter, as long as the runButton calls the right function!\nUpdating Function Calls\nNow, our runButton function should be able to handle any of our buttons! Update the onclick attribute for each button so that it calls runButton with the appropriate numeric identifier.\nAdding New Buttons\nNow, to add a new button and function, take these steps:\n\nIn the JavaScript, define a new function that will take in two values, and return the result\nCall this function within the runButton function based on its numeric identifier (e.g., 3)\nIn the HTML, create a new button that will call runButton with the numeric identifier as the parameter (e.g., 3)\n\nThat's all! Next, add buttons that will perform the following actions:\n\nDivide the two inputs\nSay whether or not the two inputs are equal (return a string)\nReturn the larger input\nReturn the average of the two inputs\nReturn the larger input minus the smaller input\n\nMore Functions - Single Input\nTry to think of possible calculations to perform on a single input.

There are a few requirements, but other than that, feel free to create anything your heart desires. The requirements are listed below, along with some ideas to help you get started.\nRequirements\nYour project must have:\nHTML\n\nAn HTML file\nA proper link to a JavaScript file\nAt least one (1) input\nAt least two (2) buttons\nAt least three (3) styles\n\nJavaScript\n\nA JavaScript file\nAt least two (2) functions\nAt least three (3) variables\nAt least one (1) if statement\nAt least one (1) else\nAt least one (1) alert\nAt least one (1) prompt\nAt least two (2) uses of DOM Manipulation:\nGetting a value from an input in JavaScript\nCreating a new HTML element in JavaScript\nUpdating the text content of an HTML element in JavaScript\nChanging a style on the page in JavaScript\n\n\n\nPresentations\nStudents will be expected to present their projects at the last meeting of the semester.\nContent\nThe presentation should include:\n\nBackground about the idea behind the website\nAn overview of the website's functionality\nAn explanation of any new topics learned\nA brief look into any relevant or interesting parts of the code\nA discussion of any challenges that arose during the project development\n\nProcedure\n\nIf a student is able to share their screen and talk through their project on Zoom, that is preferred\nIf a student does not have a microphone, they can join the Zoom meeting from a telephone\nIf a student cannot share their screen, they should share their Repl link with the instructors\n\n\nA student also has the option of recording a video presentation\nThere will be a defined schedule and order for each student to present\nIf a student does not present a final project, they may not be able to move onto the next level of Hy-Tech Club\n\nIdeas\nIf you're having trouble thinking of something you'd like to make, you can choose one of these ideas as a starting point.\nText-Based Adventure\nCreate a text-based game where the user can change the outcome based on their input. For example, the game could ask \"Which direction would you like to travel?\" and then do something different depending on if they say \"North\", \"South\", \"East\", or \"West\". You can expand the story as far as you'd like, as long as it meets the requirements above!\nPersonality Quiz / Calculator\nCreate a BuzzFeed-esque personality quiz. It should ask the user a bunch of questions, and then determine their personality (or anything else) based on their answers. You can start by thinking of some questions and answers, and figure out which answers should lead to which personalities!\nAnother option is to calculate their total score for a given personality type. For example, you could ask questions and determine how cool the user is based on their answers!\nHints\n\nStart out by asking one question, and determining the user's personality based on only that\nYou may want to keep track of points for each different personality based on the answers to questions\n\nPortfolio Website\nCreate a website that shows off some of the cool stuff you have done! If you are an artist, you can add images of your art, and create a gallery. If you are a musician, you can add some music to your page. Whatever you like to do, try to represent it on a webpage. You can also include some of the cool JavaScript stuff you have learned in class.\nExamples\n\nhttp://tobiasahlin.com/\nhttp://www.topshelfrecords.com/\nhttps://www.inakidesign.com/\nhttps://www.kkrogh.dk/\n\nTic Tac Toe\nCreate a two-player tic tac toe game. There should be a board with 9 squares, and the game should alternate Xs and Os for each click of a square. If one player gets three-in-a-row, the game should say they win. This one is very challenging!\n2D breakout game\nFollow the tutorial here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript\nOnce you complete the tutorial, augment the game with some additional features so that it meets the requirements for the final project. Maybe update the colors of the bricks or change the speed of the ball using an input. Or, start/change the game with a button. Or, build in some powerups or other challenges.
