Then, follow the instructions below to build a little text-based JavaScript program. The program will ask the user a number of questions, and then display some information using the answers the user provides.\nPart 1 - Setup\n\nAdd the html tag to your page\nAdd the head tag to your page (child of html)\nAdd the script tag to your page (child of head)\nWithin the script, add a statement that will show a message to the user welcoming them to your website.\n\nnote: a body is not required for this HTML page\nPart 2 - Asking questions\nFor each of the questions below, show a text box to the user allowing them to answer. Store all of the user's answers in their own variables. Make sure you choose good variable names!\n\nWhat is your full name?\nWhat is your favorite color?\nWhat is your favorite movie?\nWhat is the date today?\n\nPart 3 - Displaying answers\nFor each of the answers retrieved in the previous part, show the user a formatted message like \"Name: Charlie Chaplin\". For an added challenge, attempt to display all the information in only one message box. Use \\n to add a new line into the text value.\nChallenges\nFor these challenges, do some research on your own and try to figure out how to solve them. Please feel free to hop around from one challenge to another, they are not listed in order of difficulty. You should also be able to complete all of these challenges without using if statements, switch statements, for loops, or while loops (which are more advanced topics).\nThese may be helpful resources:\n\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_methods.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/js/js_date_methods.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_confirm.asp\n\nUppercase movie\nNo matter what the user enters, display their favorite movie in all in uppercase letters.\nRemoving whitespace from movie\nRemove all spaces from the beginning and end of the text the user enters for their favorite movie.\nReplacing red\nIf the user enters \"red\" as their favorite color, replace it with \"blue\" instead.\nSeparate First and Last name\nInstead of displaying the user's full name in one line, display their first name and last name separately. For this challenge, assume the user will enter their first name, then a space, then their last name.\nExample\nInstead of displaying \"Name: Charlie Chaplin\", display \"First Name: Charlie\" and \"Last Name: Chaplin\" on separate lines.\nDisplay actual date\nInstead of displaying the date the user enters, display the actual date.\nOK/Cancel\nAfter the last question, display a pop-up box that has both \"OK\" and \"Cancel\" options. The text in the box should say \"Continue?\".\n\nIf the user clicks OK, display a message saying \"You chose to continue: true\"\nIf the user clicks Cancel, display a message saying \"You chose to continue: false\"\n\nRegardless of what the user chooses to do, continue on and display their information.\nHalf-birthday\nAsk the user for their date of birth, then display their half birthday based on what they enter.\n\nAssume the user will enter their information in the form of \"MM/DD\"\nWhen displaying their half birthday, only show the month and day, in the form \"MM/DD\"\nDo not worry about leap years\n\nDays until the New Year\nIn addition to displaying today's date, display the number of days until the New Year.

Ask the user to enter a message, and then ask them how many times they would like to repeat it. Display the output.\nDice Roll\nCreate a new HTML page that, when opened, will display a message with a random number from 1-6.\nMany-sided die\nBefore displaying the random number, ask the user how many choices should be available for the dice roll. There should be no limit to the number of sides on the die. For example, if the user says \"12\", the program should display a random number from 1-12.\nVisual die\nCreate another new HTML page where, instead of simply displaying the number, it displays a visual representation of the die. For example, a roll of 2 would display \"X X \", a roll of 5 would display \"X X X X X \", and so on.\nRandom Password\nCreate a new HTML page that will generate a numeric random password for the user. First, ask the user how many characters they would like for the password (1-16). Then, generate the password for them! The password should consist of only numeric characters.\nNon-numeric password\nCreate another HTML page that will generate a random password consisting of alphanumeric characters. Ask the user how many characters they would like for the password (1-8). Then, generate the password for them! The password should consist of only lowercase letters.\nDivision with Quotient and Remainder\nCreate another HTML page that will calculate the quotient AND remainder for two numbers. Ask the user to enter the two numbers (the dividend and divisor) and then display the quotient and remainder. For example, if the user enters \"15\" for the dividend, and \"7\" for the divisor, the program should output \"7 R 1\". You can use this tool to test your math: https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/longdivision.php\nMultiply by 2\nCreate another HTML page that will multiply a given number by 2, with one catch: do not use +, -, /, or *. Ask the user for a number to multiply, and then perform the calculation. For example, if the user enters \"6\", the program should display \"12\".\nMultiply by a power of 2\nInstead of multiplying by 2 every time, ask the user for a power of 2 to multiply by. For example, if the user enters \"5\" for the number, and \"2\" for the power of 2, the program should perform the calculation 5 times (2^2), which reduces to 5 times 4, and display \"20\". In this example, the ^ symbol represents an exponent. If the user enters \"9\" for the number and \"9\" for the power of 2, the program should perform the calculation 9 times (2^9) and display \"4608\".\nRegular Expressions\nLearn about regular expressions with this tutorial: https://regexone.com/\nThen, create another HTML page that will test a string against a regular expression. For example, if the user entered \"Hello\" for the string, and \"ello\" for the regular expression, the program should display \"true\". If the user entered \"Hello\" for the string, and \"ello2\" for the regular expression, the program should display \"false\".\n"},"Week04/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"Week04/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 4 - Buttons","keywords":"","body":"Web 102: Buttons\nReference\n\nButtons PowerPoint Presentation\n\nActivities\n\nSoundboard Code-Along\n\nPractice\n\nSoundboard Individual\nChallenges\n\n"},"Week04/SoundboardIndividualInstructions.html":{"url":"Week04/SoundboardIndividualInstructions.html","title":"Soundboard Individual Exercise","keywords":"","body":"Darth Vader \"Sound\" board: Individual Exercises\nUpdate the soundboard with some additional quotes and buttons!\nResource: Making Buttons\nRemember, the steps to add a button for a quote are as follows:\n\nCreate a new button element in the HTML file, and give it text to display\nDefine a new function in the JS file\nTo define a function, use the function keyword, a function name, and curly brackets\n\n\nWithin the body of the function, use an alert to display the quote in a message\nBack in the HTML file, set the onclick attribute of the button so that it calls the function\nTo call a function, use the function name and open/close parentheses\n\n\nOpen your webpage in the browser to test the button!\n\nMore Quotes\nAdd new buttons for each of the following quotes:\n\n\"He will join us or die, Master.\"\n\"There is no escape.
