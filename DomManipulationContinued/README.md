# Week 7: DOM Manipulation Part 2
Show how DOM manipulation can be used to update the HTML of a webpage. This lesson covers:

- Updating existing HTML elements
- Creating new HTML elements

## Warm-Up: Question
Pose the following question to the students:

>How much HTML do you think professional web developers write?

Interestingly, professional web developers do not typically write raw HTML at all! They often use frameworks that allow them to generate the HTML for a webpage automatically. In this lesson, students will see how it is possible to create HTML _programmatically_.

## Lecture: Updating HTML with JavaScript
Present the [DOM Manipulation Continued PowerPoint](DomManipulationContinued.pptx) to show more DOM possibilities, like updating or creating HTML elements.

### Additional Guide
There is also a [written guide](DomManipulationUpdateHtml.md) for reference.

## Code-Along: Lyrics Builder
Follow the [instructions](LyricsCodeAlong.md) to build up to a simple app that adds lines of a song into a container one-by-one. Be sure to ask the students for suggestions about where to go next. There is no need to spend too long on this.

## Formative Assessment: Kahoot
After the students have learned about DOM Manipulation, and completed the follow-along, test their retention with a [Kahoot quiz](https://create.kahoot.it/details/7bc99cd7-493b-4353-ac53-111b2a0488b3).

## Self-Paced Work: Background Changer
The students should follow the [self-paced work instructions](SelfPacedWork.md) to complete the activity.

## Challenges
There are a couple [challenges](Challenges/) for the students.

### Shopping List Challenge
This [challenge](Challenges/ShoppingListChallenge.md) is copied from [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents#Active_learning_A_dynamic_shopping_list).

The main challenge here is the "Delete" button for a given shopping list item. To implement that, the students will have to do some research. They will have to:

- Set up the `onclick` binding function in JavaScript for the button they create
- Use `.removeChild` on the list element to remove the whole list item

### Table Data Challenge
The [Table Data challenge](Challenges/TableDataChallenge.md) has the students create a table with a few columns. There should then be a few input fields and a button, where the user should be able to add a new row to the table.
