# Functions and Review
Dive deeper into the concepts behind functions and practice using them. This lesson covers:
- Function parameters

## Warm-Up
The [warm-up activity](WarmUp.md) is a little quiz with some review questions. Students should answer the questions in a new text file, or on paper. Give the students 5-10 minutes to complete the quiz, and then go over the answers briefly.

## Lecture
The lecture formalizes functions a little more, and introduces parameters.

## Follow-Along: DiceRoller
Follow the instructions in [DiceRollerFollowAlong](DiceRollerFollowAlong.md) to build up a webpage capable of rolling different types of dice. Start from the [DiceRoller Repl](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/DiceRollerStart). This walkthrough covers:

- Defining multiple functions
- Random number generation
- Abstracting functionality with a parameter
- Calling a function with different parameters
- Creating multiple buttons
- Using DOM manipulation to show messages to the user

## Individual Exercise: Background Images
Have the students follow [the instructions](IndividualInstructions.md) to create a webpage that allows the user to change the background image dynamically. To do this, they will define a function that takes a parameter. They will call that function from within another function. They will also use DOM Manipulation to get an image URL from a text box in the HTML. At the end, the project should look [something like this](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/BackgroundChangerComplete).

## Challenges
There are some additional challenges in the [Challenge](Challenge.md) instructions file. If a student finishes the individual exercise with time to spare, they can attempt the challenges.
