# Existing Projects
One of the most important parts of software development is reading and understanding code written by someone else. For this challenge, take some existing projects, and make them your own by changing the values of some variables. All the important variables should be at the very top of the **script.js** file in each project.

>Note: Many of these projects use external libraries or advanced JS features

>Note 2: These examples were created for a program that involved a scavenger hunt, so there may be some clues hidden throughout

## The HTML5 Canvas
The [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) provides a means for drawing graphics via JavaScript and the HTML `<canvas>` element.

## Processing with p5.js
The [p5.js library](https://p5js.org/) makes creative coding possible - you can make all kinds of different art with it. Here are some example projects:

- [Embers](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/Embers)
- [Waves](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/Waves)
- [Greet](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/Greet)

### Advanced Examples: Fractals
The code for these projects is a bit more complex, but it does some interesting things.

## Phaser: Platformer Game
The [Phaser framework](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser#phaser---html5-game-framework) is one way to make games with JavaScript.
