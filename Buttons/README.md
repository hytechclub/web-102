## Warm-Up: Blooket
Facilitate the [Blooket](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/65b8eeccf29aed4ff8bea349) that covers the content from the previous session.

## Presentation: Buttons
The [presentation](Buttons.pptx) covers functions and buttons.

## Formative Assessment: Review Activity
After the presentation, play a game to review some of the concepts covered up until this point.

Have the students split into two teams. Each team will line up, and have one representative face off against a representative from the opposing team. Questions are in the [Review](Review.pptx) slides - the answers are in the slides following each question. If a student gets the answer right (regardless of speed), they win a point for their team. Keep track of the points on the whiteboard. The winning team receives candy. There is a tie-breaker at the end that should be based on speed.

## Code-Along: Story Time
Lead the students through the [code-along activity](StoryTimeCodeAlong.md).

## Self-Paced Work
There are a variety of self-paced work options listed at the end of the code-along activity.

- Bonus Challenge: Multiple Pages
- [Practice: Character Soundboard](SoundboardCodeAlong.md)
- [Final Project Inspiration & Ideation](SelfPacedWork.md)
