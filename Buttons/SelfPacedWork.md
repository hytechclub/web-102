# Self-Paced Work: Final Project Inspiration & Ideation
Think about what kind of project you might want to create using JavaScript.

## Sample Projects
There are some sample final projects that can be used as influences for your own final project. You don't have to worry about understanding all the code yet, but you can explore the websites and see if they give you any ideas for what you might want to do:

## Idea Submission
Once you have a few ideas, you can submit them using [this form](https://forms.office.com/r/tYA8YwL8XN).

They do not have to be full-fledged plans, but try to think of at least three to submit!
