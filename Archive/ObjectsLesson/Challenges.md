# Challenges
Complete the following challenges to update the Profile Builder webpage.

## Image
Add a profile image to the page.

1. Add an `img` to the HTML file
1. Add a URL property to the `profileInfo` object
1. In the `generateProfile` function, update the `src` property of the `img` to point to the URL

## Dynamic Updates
Instead of updating each property with a separate button, define a function that will ask the user which property they would like to update. Then, the function should update the property with whatever value they provide.

## Fetch
>Resource: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch

Instead of using data that is hard-coded into the JavaScript, it is possible to retrieve that data from somewhere else on the web using `fetch`! Use a [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/documentation#howto) to fill in the Profile Builder profile with random data instead of hard-coded data.
