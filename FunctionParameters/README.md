# Week 9: Functions and Review
Dive deeper into the concepts behind functions and practice using them. This lesson covers function parameters.

## Warm-Up: Quiz
The [warm-up activity](WarmUp.md) is a little quiz with some review questions. Students should answer the questions in a new text file, or on paper. Give the students 5-10 minutes to complete the quiz, and then go over the answers briefly.

## Lecture: Function Parameters
The [presentation](FunctionParameters.pptx) formalizes functions a little more, and introduces parameters.

## Code-Along: Dice Roller
Follow the [instructions](DiceRollerCodeAlong.md) to build up a webpage capable of rolling different types of dice. This walkthrough covers:

- Defining multiple functions
- Random number generation
- Abstracting functionality with a parameter
- Calling a function with different parameters
- Creating multiple buttons
- Using DOM manipulation to show messages to the user

## Self-Paced Work: Background Images
Have the students follow [the instructions](SelfPacedWork.md) to create a webpage that allows the user to change the background image dynamically. To do this, they will define a function that takes a parameter. They will call that function from within another function. They will also use DOM Manipulation to get an image URL from a text box in the HTML. At the end, the project should look [something like this](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/BackgroundChangerComplete).

## Challenges
There are some additional [challenges](Challenges.md). If a student finishes the self-paced work with time to spare, they can attempt the challenges.
