# Arrays
Introduce [arrays](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp) as a way to store list data.

Note that it is more important for students to be able to _use_ arrays than fully understand them. If they can memorize the basic structure and syntax, that should be sufficient.

## Warm-Up: Top Ten Restaurants
Have the students complete the warm-up activity by following [the instructions](WarmUp.md). The idea is to show them an example of collections in action. Give them a few minutes to re-order their lists, and then maybe a few minutes for some students to shout out their top restaurants.

## Lecture: Arrays
The [presentation](Arrays.pptx) introduces the concept of arrays, explains their importance, and shows the JavaScript syntax.

## Formative Assessment: Blooket
Facilitate the [Blooket quiz game](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/634d515cc58b2e2965206248). Note than an account is required to host the game.

## Code-Along: Movie Watchlist
Follow the [instructions](WatchlistCodeAlong.md) to build up a website meant to track movies on a watchlist.

## Self-Paced Work: Movie Watchlist Updates
Have the students follow [the instructions](SelfPacedWork.md) to continue working on the movie watchlist website.

## Challenges
There are some additional [challenges](Challenges.md).
