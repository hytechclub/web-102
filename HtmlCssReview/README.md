# Week 1: HTML & CSS Review
Review content from HTML and CSS. Note, depending on how much the students remember, it may be worth spending more than one session on these concepts.

## Student Introductions
Since this is the first week of the club, allow the students to introduce themselves. They can share their school and grade level, and something fun like their favorite movie or tv show or an interesting fact about themselves.

## Icebreaker: Online Pictionary
The first session should begin with a quick icebreaker activity where the instructors and students can introduce themselves.

Create a new private room in [Drawasaurus](https://www.drawasaurus.org/) (online pictionary). Keep the round count and draw time to small numbers to limit the total amount of time for the activity. In the "Custom Words" text area, add some HTML- and CSS-related words that the students should recognize from Web 101. For example:

```
HTML, CSS, element, attribute, style, tag, h1, paragraph, img, link,
list, ul, ol, list item, input, textarea, button, table, iframe, div,
span, background, color, font-size, class, id, selector, text-align,
height, width, font-family, responsive, bootstrap
```

Play the game with the students!

## Code-Along: HTML & CSS Review
Walk through [the code-along instructions](HtmlCssReviewCodeAlong.md) with the students.

## Self-Paced Work: "About Me" Websites
The students should work on their "About Me" websites on their own, following [the instructions](IntroduceYourself.md). They will need to build out a basic HTML file from scratch, using the concepts reviewed in the Code-Along. The webpage will be them introducing themselves to the rest of the class, and each student can present what they come up with briefly.

## Challenges
If the students complete the Individual activity with time to spare, they can attempt the [challenges](Challenges.md).

## Formative Assessment: Kahoot
End the session with a [Kahoot](https://create.kahoot.it/share/9da0c22b-48ae-479f-9c7f-c0bfd458a2b5) to gauge what the students ultimately remember from HTML/CSS.
