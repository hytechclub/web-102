# Week 10: For Loops
Introduce [`for` loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration) as a way to repeat code automatically.

Note that it is more important for students to be able to _use_ for loops than fully understand each part of them. If they can memorize the basic structure and syntax, that should be sufficient.

## Warm-Up: Counter
Have the students complete the warm-up activity by following [the instructions](WarmUp.md). The idea is to show how annoying it is to repeat code manually.

## Lecture: For Loops
The [presentation](ForLoops.pptx) introduces the concept of looping, explains its importance, and shows the JavaScript syntax.

## Formative Assessment: Blooket Quiz Game
Facilitate the [Blooket](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/632875ba32e5ef11ac0231c4) to give students a chance to review the concepts from the lecture. Note that a Blooket account is required to host the game.

## Code-Along: Library of Babel
Follow the [instructions](BabelCodeAlong.md) to update a webpage so that it uses a `for` loop. This will make the code much more maintainable and extendable.

There is a video at the start of the walkthrough - show the first three minutes or so. Make sure not to go beyond those three minutes, but note that students can watch the full video later if they desire.

## Self-Paced Work: Babel Updates
Have the students follow [the instructions](SelfPacedWork.md) to continue working on the Babel website. At the end, if they complete all of the challenge portions, the project should look [something like this](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/honorable-tabby-papyrus). Note that the challenge portions of the self-paced work may be more challenging than the separate challenges - students can feel free to hop around and work on what they would like.

## Challenges
There are some additional [challenges](Challenges.md). The first few challenges may actually be easier than the challenge portions of the self-paced work, so students are welcome to switch over even if they do not complete all the babel updates.
