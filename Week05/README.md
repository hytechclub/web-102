# Week 5: Booleans and Conditional Statements
Introduce program flow and the boolean data type. This lesson covers:

- The Boolean data type
- Conditional Statements

## Warm Up
Start things off with a review quiz. There is a [quizizz](https://quizizz.com/admin/quiz/5bacd1a1abe7b5001921fb7d/javascript-basics-review) with the questions. This quiz covers the content leading up to this lesson.

A Quizizz account is required to present the quiz. If there are issues with Quizizz, there is also a [Blooket](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/6307aea9c892499a2745fc1f) quiz with the same questions (a Blooket account is required).

## Lecture: Booleans & Conditional Statements
The [presentation](Conditionals.pptx) introduces booleans and conditional statements. It attempts to express that the computer understands these statements in the same way humans understand English (or any other language). The presentation also includes a mini-quiz.

## Conditional Debugging Activity
Give students a chance to work on the [Conditional Debugging activity](ConditionalDebugging.md) independently. After 5-10 minutes, go over the bug fixes as a group.

## Code-Along: Chatbot
Follow [the instructions](ChatbotCodeAlong.md) to walk through the construction of a rudimentary chatbot that can respond to some messages.

## Self-Paced Work: Chatbot Updates
Have students work on the [self-paced work](ChatbotSelfPaced.md) where they will add more to the chatbot.

## Challenges
There are a variety of [challenges](Challenges.md) for the students to attempt.
