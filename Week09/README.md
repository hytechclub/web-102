# JavaScript Objects
Introduce JavaScript objects

## Virtual Note
For a virtual 11-week semester, this lesson will be optional.

### Final Review
Have the students complete the [final review Quizizz](https://quizizz.com/admin/quiz/5cb4ab688f1e35001d3e267c/web-final-review).

Note that a Quizizz account is required to start the quiz. If there are issues, there is a [Kahoot](https://create.kahoot.it/details/369adee2-1c36-4dec-8bb2-4a74aa055e4f) with the same questions. Encourage students to take their time to answer correctly; for the Kahoot, no points will be given for any question except the last one. The main goal is to actually assess their knowledge at the end of the course. 

### Final Project Introductions
After the final review, introduce the [Final Projects](../Week11/FinalProject.md) and have the students begin working on them. Show them some examples of final projects. By the end of class, they should at least have an idea of what they might like to do for it.
