# Warm-Up: Counting
In this activity, build a simple counting program that displays numbers sequentially! Ah ah ah!

Start by forking [this starter Repl project](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/TheCount#script.js).

The project has some basic setup: an HTML `<button>` that calls a function named `count` when it is clicked. The function is defined as follows:

```js
function count() {
  alert("Here we go!");
  alert(1);
  alert(2);
  alert(3);
  alert(4);
}
```

Your goal is to make the `count` function display numbers all the way up to `100`! Open up the **script.js** file, and update the body of the `count` function so that it has more `alert` statements, each counting up one more.

## Challenge
For an extra challenge, update the `count` function so that instead of using `alert`, it updates some of the actual HTML on the page. Try to make it so that every time the "Count" button is clicked, it adds another number to the page.
