# Conditionals
This lesson introduces conditionals (`if`/`else`) and boolean statements.

## Warm-Up: Review Quiz
Present the [Blooket](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/6307aea9c892499a2745fc1f) quiz that covers the material from the previous sessions.

## Lecture: Booleans & Conditional Statements
The [presentation](Conditionals.pptx) introduces booleans and conditional statements. It attempts to express that the computer understands these statements in the same way humans understand English (or any other language). The presentation also includes a mini-quiz.

## Conditional Debugging Activity
Give students a chance to work on the [Conditional Debugging activity](ConditionalDebugging.md) independently. After 5-10 minutes, go over the bug fixes as a group.

## Code-Along: Chatbot
Follow [the instructions](ChatbotCodeAlong.md) to walk through the construction of a rudimentary chatbot that can respond to some messages.

## Self-Paced Work
There are a wide variety of options for the self-paced portion, all described [here](SelfPacedWork.md)

## Baamboozle Quiz
At that point, bring everybody together and facilitate the [Baamboozle Team Quiz](https://www.baamboozle.com/game/1496316). The students should split into two teams, and the instructor should click through questions. Note that Baamboozle is _very_ unfair when using power-ups, and the best team may not win - but that's okay!
