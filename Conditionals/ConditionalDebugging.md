# Self-Paced Work: Conditional Debugging
One of the most important parts of programming is [debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging) - the process of finding and fixing errors in code. In this activity, practice debugging an existing program.

Start by remixing [this project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/conditional-bugs). Test out the buttons to see how they work - each of them has an issue. Fix all of the issues in the functions for each of the buttons. All changes should take place in the **script.js** file.
