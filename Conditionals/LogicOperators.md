# Exploration: Logic Operators & Logic Gates
Logic operators can be very useful when controlling program flow for a piece of software, but they are so much more than that. They also serve as the basis of all modern computers. Logic gates power the circuits that allow all software to exist!

First, read up a bit on the [logical operators available in JavaScript](https://javascript.info/logical-operators).

Next, read up on how [logic gates work with boolean (on/off) values in circuits](https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/logic-gates/).

Finally, play with these interactive tools to explore booleans and computer logic at its most fundamental level: 

- [Basic Gates Introduction](https://www.advanced-ict.info/interactive/circuits.html)
- [NAND Game](https://nandgame.com/)

And just for fun, [try to figure out some logic puzzles](https://www.mathsisfun.com/puzzles/logic-puzzles-index.html).
