# Week 2: Introduction to JavaScript
Introduce JavaScript at a basic level. This should be a fairly light introduction. This lesson covers:
- `alert` function
- variables
- `prompt` function

## Warm Up
Ask the students to answer the following questions:
- What are your favorite websites?
- What can you do to interact with those websites? E.g., clicking buttons, typing in fields, etc.

Discussion will take place during the lecture.

## Lecture
The first lecture defines JavaScript and explains how developers use JavaScript.

The second lecture dives in to the following concepts:
- Script tag
- `alert`
- Variables
- `prompt`

### Variables Activity - In-Person
During the second lecture, after introducing variables, instructors can use this tangible representation of variables to help explain them. Use cups, nametags, and scraps of paper to represent what's happening in the computer.

- A **cup** represents a block of space in memory
    - It may be helpful to have multiple cups to indicate many blocks of memory
- A **nametag** represents a variable
- A **scrap of paper** represents a value

Place a **nametag** on a **cup** to represent _declaring_ a variable. The nametag should have the name of the variable written on it.

Place a **scrap of paper** in a **cup** to represent _setting_ the value of a variable. The paper should have some text written on it.

Pull the **scrap of paper** out of a **cup** to represent _using_ a variable. After looking at the value, return the paper to the cup.

>Note: This activity can be skipped in a hybrid or virtual setting.
