### Note: `let` and `var`
In modern JavaScript, the `let` keyword is preferred over the `var` keyword in most cases. For the purposes of this course, the two keywords are all but interchangeable; however, `let` should be the standard. There may be instances of `var` in some of this curriculum; those should all be replaced with `let`. [The differences between `let` and `var` are far beyond the scope (haha) of this course](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let#description).

## Warm-Up: Intros & Icebreaker
Since this is the first week of the club, allow the students to introduce themselves. They can share their school and grade level, and something fun like their favorite movie or tv show or an interesting fact about themselves.

After that, create a new private room in [Drawasaurus](https://www.drawasaurus.org/) (online pictionary). Keep the round count and draw time to small numbers to limit the total amount of time for the activity. In the "Custom Words" text area, add some HTML- and CSS-related words that the students should recognize from Web 101. For example:

```
HTML, CSS, element, attribute, style, tag, h1, paragraph, img, link,
list, ul, ol, list item, input, textarea, button, table, iframe, div,
span, background, color, font-size, class, id, selector, text-align,
height, width, font-family, responsive, bootstrap
```

Play the game with the students!

## HyTop Setup
Make sure all the students setup an account in [HyTop](https://hylandtechclub.com/HyTopSetup.html). When they create their first project, they can use it for the duration of this session.

## Code-Along: HTML & CSS Review
Walk through [the code-along instructions](HtmlCssReviewCodeAlong.md) with the students.

## Lecture 1: Introduction to JavaScript
The [first presentation](IntroductionToJavaScript.pptx) defines JavaScript and explains how developers use JavaScript.

There is a mini-challenge within the lecture - students should create a new project and open the **script.js** file to complete it. 

## Lecture 2: JavaScript Variables
The [second presentation](JavaScriptVariables.pptx) dives in to the following concepts:

- Script tag
- `alert`
- Variables
- `prompt`

There are further mini-challenges within this lecture - students should use the same project from the first lecture.

## Self-Paced Work: Questions Exercise
The students can practice the concepts from the lesson by following the [Self-Paced Work](SelfPacedWork.md) instructions; they will build a simple website that asks the user some questions, and then displays the answers. There is also a [solution for the basic self-paced work](SelfPacedWorkComplete.js).

Some additional challenges are also included within the instructions. There are also [solutions for the challenges](ChallengesComplete.js).

## Formative Assessment: Blooket
With any remaining time, facilitate the [Blooket](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/65b8eeccf29aed4ff8bea349) that covers the content from the lectures.
