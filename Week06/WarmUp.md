# Warm Up: Cotton Candy Inputs
Start by opening up [this Repl](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/CssRefresher) and creating a fork. It contains a simple HTML page that has a header and two input boxes.

The goal of this activity is to give one of the boxes a pink background, and the other one an aqua background.

1. Open the **index.html** file for editing
1. Add an `id` attribute to the first `<input>` element, and set it to `pink`
1. Add an `id` attribute to the _second_ `<input>` element, and set _it_ to `aqua`
1. Open the **style.css** file for editing
1. Create a new _ruleset_ selecting the `pink` input by its `id`
1. Within the `#pink { }` ruleset, use `background: pink;` to set the background color to pink
1. Repeat the steps above for a `#aqua` ruleset - set its background color to `aqua`

Click the **Run** button, and make sure the two inputs appear with the proper cotton candy colors!

## Challenge
For an additional challenge, create a third input that should have a `lavender` background color.
