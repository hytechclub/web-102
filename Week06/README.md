# Week 6: DOM Manipulation Part 1
Show how the Document Object Model can make JavaScript more interactive by manipulating HTML and CSS. This lesson covers:

- Retrieving values from inputs and using them in JavaScript

## Warm-Up: CSS Refresher
Review some HTML/CSS concepts before diving into the JavaScript by having the students complete the [Warm-Up Activity](WarmUp.md). The concept of selecting elements by ID in CSS will transfer to JS. Give the students no more than 5 minutes to accomplish this, and then briefly present the solution.

## Lecture: DOM Manipulation Introduction
Present the [DOM Manipulation Intro PowerPoint](DomManipulationIntro.pptx) to introduce DOM manipulation.

### Additional Guide
There is also a [written guide](DomManipulationReadFromInput.md) for reference.

## Code-Along: Mad Libs Redux
Follow the [Mad Libs code-along](MadLibsCodeAlong.md) instructions to complete the basic Mad Libs page as a group.

## Self-Paced Work: Mad Libs Updates
Students should follow the [self-paced instructions](SelfPacedWork.md) to update the Mad Libs page.

## Challenges
There are some [challenges](Challenges.md) for the students.
